	abstract = {A high-dimensional shape transformation posed in a mass-preserving framework is used as a morphological signature of a brain image. Population differences with complex spatial patterns are then determined by applying a nonlinear support vector machine ({SVM)} pattern classification method to the morphological signatures. Significant reduction of the dimensionality of the morphological signatures is achieved via wavelet decomposition and feature reduction methods. Applying the method to {MR} images with simulated atrophy shows that the method can correctly detect subtle and spatially complex atrophy, even when the simulated atrophy represents only a 5\% variation from the original image. Applying this method to actual {MR} images shows that brains can be correctly determined to be male or female with a successful classification rate of 97\%, using the leave-one-out method. This proposed method also shows a high classification rate for old adults' age classification, even under difficult test scenarios. The main characteristic of the proposed methodology is that, by applying multivariate pattern classification methods, it can detect subtle and spatially complex patterns of morphological group differences which are often not detectable by voxel-based morphometric methods, because these methods analyze morphological measurements voxel-by-voxel and do not consider the entirety of the data simultaneously.},

Thickness maps were analyzed using three different discriminant techniques to separate patients from controls. All analyses were performed using leave-one-out cross-validation to avoid overtraining of the discriminants. The results show regionally variant patterns of discrimination ability, with over 90\% accuracy obtained in the medial temporal lobes and other limbic structures. Multivariate discriminant analysis produced 100\% accuracy with six different combinations, all involving the parahippocampal gyrus. We therefore propose automated measurements of cortical thickness as a tool to improve the clinical diagnosis of probable {AD}, as well as a research method to gain unique insight into the etiology of cortical pathology in the disease. © 2006.},

	abstract = {Functional and structural maturation of networks comprised of discrete regions is an important aspect of brain development. The default-mode network ({DMN)} is a prominent network which includes the posterior cingulate cortex ({PCC)}, medial prefrontal cortex ({mPFC)}, medial temporal lobes ({MTL)}, and angular gyrus ({AG).} Despite increasing interest in {DMN} function, little is known about its maturation from childhood to adulthood. Here we examine developmental changes in {DMN} connectivity using a multimodal imaging approach by combining resting-state {fMRI}, voxel-based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging-based tractography. We found that the {DMN} undergoes significant developmental changes in functional and structural connectivity, but these changes are not uniform across all {DMN} nodes. Convergent structural and functional connectivity analyses suggest that {PCC-mPFC} connectivity along the cingulum bundle is the most immature link in the {DMN} of children. Both {PCC} and {mPFC} also showed gray matter volume differences, as well as prominent macrostructural and microstructural differences in the dorsal cingulum bundle linking these regions. Notably, structural connectivity between {PCC} and left {MTL} was either weak or non-existent in children, even though functional connectivity did not differ from that of adults. These results imply that functional connectivity in children can reach adult-like levels despite weak structural connectivity. We propose that maturation of {PCC-mPFC} structural connectivity plays an important role in the development of self-related and social-cognitive functions that emerge during adolescence. More generally, our study demonstrates how quantitative multimodal analysis of anatomy and connectivity allows us to better characterize the heterogeneous development and maturation of brain networks.},

The graph Laplacian is split into two components: within-class graph and between-class graph to better characterize the discriminant property of the data. Our approach has two important characteristics: (i) it adaptively estimates the local neighborhood surrounding each sample based on data density and similarity and (ii) the objective function simultaneously maximizes the local margin between heterogeneous samples and pushes the homogeneous samples closer to each other. Our approach has been tested on several challenging face databases and it has been conveniently compared with other linear and non-linear techniques, demonstrating its superiority. Although we have concentrated in this paper on the face recognition problem, the proposed approach could also be applied to other category of objects characterized by large variations in their appearance (such as hand or body pose, for instance). © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Magnetic Resonance Imaging ({MRI)} provides various imaging modes to study the brain. We tested the benefits of a joint analysis of multimodality {MRI} data in combination with a large-scale analysis that involved simultaneously all image voxels using joint independent components analysis ({jICA)} and compared the outcome to results using conventional voxel-by-voxel unimodality tests. Specifically, we designed a {jICA} to decompose multimodality {MRI} data into independent components that explain joint variations between the image modalities as well as variations across brain regions. We tested the {jICA} design on structural and perfusion-weighted {MRI} data from 12 patients diagnosed with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia ({bvFTD)} and 12 cognitively normal elderly individuals. While unimodality analyses showed widespread brain atrophy and hypoperfusion in the patients, {jICA} further revealed two significant joint components of variations between atrophy and hypoperfusion across brain regions. The 1st joint component revealed associated brain atrophy and hypoperfusion predominantly in the right brain hemisphere in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, and the 2nd joint component revealed greater atrophy relative to hypoperfusion affecting predominantly the left hemisphere in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia. The patterns are consistent with the clinical symptoms of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia that relate to asymmetric compromises of the left and right brain hemispheres. The joint components also revealed that that structural alterations can be associated with physiological alterations in spatially separated but potentially connected brain regions. Finally, {jICA} outperformed voxel-by-voxel unimodal tests significantly in terms of an effect size, separating the behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia patients from the controls. Taken together, the results demonstrate the benefit of multimodality {MRI} in conjunction with {jICA} for mapping neurodegeneration, which may lead ultimately to an improved diagnosis of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and other forms of neurodegenerative diseases.},

What emerges are spatial patterns of brain activity that represent the optimal association between the images and either of the blocks. This process differs substantially from other multivariate methods in that rather than attempting to predict the individual values of the image pixels, {PLS} attempts to explain the relation between image pixels and task or behavior. Data from a face encoding and recognition {PET} {rCBF} study are used to illustrate two types of {PLS} analysis: an activation analysis of task with images and a brain–behavior analysis. The commonalities across the two analyses are suggestive of a general face memory network differentially engaged during encoding and recognition. {PLS} thus serves as an important extension by extracting new information from imaging data that is not accessible through other currently used univariate and multivariate image analysis tools.},

Graphs are formed that represent the connectivity of voxel segments in the foreground and background of the image. These graphs are analyzed and minimal corrections to the volume are made prior to tessellation. We apply the algorithm to a simple test object and to cerebral white matter masks generated by a low-level tissue identification sequence. We tessellate the resulting objects using the marching cubes algorithm and verify their topology by computing their Euler characteristics. A key benefit of the algorithm is that it localizes the change to a volume to the specific areas of its topological defects.},

	abstract = {Abstract
Although both normal aging and Alzheimer's disease ({AD)} are associated with regional cortical atrophy, few studies have directly compared the spatial patterns and magnitude of effects of these two processes. The extant literature has not addressed two important questions: 1) Is the pattern of age-related cortical atrophy different if cognitively intact elderly individuals with silent {AD} pathology are excluded? and 2) Does the age- or {AD-related} atrophy relate to cognitive function? Here we studied 142 young controls, 87 older controls, and 28 mild {AD} patients. In addition, we studied 35 older controls with neuroimaging data indicating the absence of brain amyloid. Whole-cortex analyses identified regions of interest ({ROIs)} of cortical atrophy in aging and in {AD.} Results showed that some regions are predominantly affected by age with relatively little additional atrophy in patients with {AD}, e.g., calcarine cortex; other regions are predominantly affected by {AD} with much less of an effect of age, e.g., medial temporal cortex. Finally, other regions are affected by both aging and {AD}, e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal lobule. Thus, the processes of aging and {AD} have both differential and partially overlapping effects on specific regions of the cerebral cortex. In particular, some frontoparietal regions are affected by both processes, most temporal lobe regions are affected much more prominently by {AD} than aging, while sensorimotor and some prefrontal regions are affected specifically by aging and minimally more by {AD.} Within normal older adults, atrophy in aging-specific cortical regions relates to cognitive performance, while in {AD} patients atrophy in {AD-specific} regions relates to cognitive performance. Further work is warranted to investigate the behavioral and clinical relevance of these findings in additional detail, as well as their histological basis; {ROIs} generated from the present study could be used strategically in such investigations.},

The major goal is to use all modalities simultaneously to transform very high dimensional image to a lower dimensional representation in a discriminative way. In addition to being discriminative, the proposed approach has the advantage of being clinically interpretable. We propose a framework based on regularized tensor decomposition. We show that different variants of tensor factorization imply various hypothesis about data. Inspired by the idea of multi-view dimensionality reduction in machine learning community, two different kinds of tensor decomposition and their implications are presented. We have validated our method on a multi-modal longitudinal brain imaging study. We compared this method with a publically available classification software based on {SVM} that has shown state-of-the-art classification rate in number of publications.},

However, dedicated analysis methods are needed to exploit the potential of multimodal methods. Many solutions to this data integration problem have been proposed, which often renders both comparisons of results and the choice of the right method for the data at hand difficult. In this review we will discuss different multimodal neuroimaging setups, the advances achieved in basic research and clinical application and the methods used.

We experimented with 120 combinations of automatic face detection, face alignment and gender classification. One of the findings was that the automatic face alignment methods did not increase the gender classification rates. However, manual alignment increased classification rates a little, which suggests that automatic alignment would be useful when the alignment methods are further improved. We also found that the gender classification methods performed almost equally well with different input image sizes. In any case, the best classification rate was achieved with a support vector machine. A neural network and Adaboost achieved almost as good classification rates as the support vector machine and could be used in applications where classification speed is considered more important than the best possible classification accuracy. © 2008 {IEEE.}},

We identify two diametrically opposed, widely distributed brain networks on the basis of both spontaneous correlations within each network and anticorrelations between networks. One network consists of regions routinely exhibiting task-related activations and the other of regions routinely exhibiting task-related deactivations. This intrinsic organization, featuring the presence of anticorrelated networks in the absence of overt task performance, provides a critical context in which to understand brain function. We suggest that both task-driven neuronal responses and behavior are reflections of this dynamic, ongoing, functional organization of the brain.},

The strength of our approach lies not so much in the clustering itself, but rather in the definition and use of two cluster-validity indices that are independent of the cluster topology.

This is achieved by relying on integral images for image convolutions; by building on the strengths of the leading existing detectors and descriptors (in casu, using a Hessian matrix-based measure for the detector, and a distribution-based descriptor); and by simplifying these methods to the essential. This leads to a combination of novel detection, description, and matching steps.

However, little is known about the rate of decline in those subjects. In this cohort study, we aimed to assess the conversion rate to dementia and identify prognostic markers in subjects with {MCI} and evidence of amyloid pathology.
{METHODS:} We pooled subjects from the {VU} University Medical Center Alzheimer Center and the Development of Screening Guidelines and Criteria for Predementia Alzheimer's Disease ({DESCRIPA)} study. We included subjects with {MCI}, an abnormal level of β-amyloid(1-42) (Aβ(1-42)) in the {CSF}, and at least one diagnostic follow-up visit. We assessed the effect of {APOE} genotype, {CSF} total tau (t-tau) and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau) and hippocampal volume on time to {AD-type} dementia using Cox proportional hazards models and on decline on the Mini-Mental State Examination ({MMSE)} using linear mixed models.
{RESULTS:} We included 110 subjects with {MCI} with abnormal {CSF} Aβ(1-42) and a mean {MMSE} score of 26.3 ± 2.8. During a mean follow-up of 2.2 ± 1.0 (range 0.4-5.0) years, 63 subjects (57\%) progressed to {AD-type} dementia. Abnormal {CSF} t-tau (hazard ratio [{HR]} 2.3, 95\% confidence interval [{CI]} 1.1-4.6, p = 0.03) and {CSF} p-tau ({HR} 3.5, 95\% {CI} 1.3-9.2, p = 0.01) concentration and hippocampal atrophy ({HR} 2.5, 95\% {CI} 1.1-5.6, p = 0.02) predicted time to dementia. For subjects with both abnormal t-tau concentration and hippocampal atrophy, {HR} was 7.3 (95\% {CI} 1.0-55.9, p = 0.06). Furthermore, abnormal {CSF} t-tau and p-tau concentrations and hippocampal atrophy predicted decline in {MMSE} score.

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}

To develop an automatic atlas-based method for segmentation of fiber bundles using High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging ({HARDI)} data.


{HYPOTHESIS}

Quantitative evaluation of diffusion characteristics inside specific fiber bundles provides new insights into disease developments, evolutions, therapy effects, and surgical interventions.


{BACKGROUND}

Most of previous segmentation methods use similarity measures and strategies that do not lead to accurate segmentation results. They also suffer from subjectivity of initial seeds and regions of interest ({ROI)} defined by operator.


{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}

We propose a novel method that uses Spherical Harmonic Coefficients ({SHC)} of {HARDI} diffusion signals to compute Orientation Distribution Function ({ODF)} and to extract Principal Diffusion Directions ({PDDs).} The proposed method selects most collinear {PDD} of neighbors of each voxel. Then, based on {SHC} and selected {PDD}, a similarity measure is proposed and used as a speed function in the level set framework that segments fiber bundles. To automate the process, an atlas-based method is used to select initial seeds for fiber bundles. To generate data for evaluation of the proposed method, an artificial pattern consisting of three crossing bundles intersected by a circular bundle is created. Also, two normal controls are imaged by two different {HARDI} protocols.


{RESULTS}

Segmentation results for different fiber bundles in simulated data and normal control data are presented. Influence of threshold selection on the proposed segmentation method is evaluated using Dice coefficient. Also, effect of increasing the number of gradient directions on accuracy of extracted {PDDs} is evaluated.


{CONCLUSION}

The proposed segmentation method has advantages over previous methods especially those that use similarity measures based on diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI)} data. These advantages are achieved by proper propagation of a hyper-surface in fiber crossing areas without making assumptions about diffusivity profile and selection of initial seeds or {ROI.}},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the head and trunk equilibrium strategies while walking forwards and backwards under different conditions (eyes open vs. closed, hard vs. soft surface) in a sample of 11 consenting healthy adult subjects. Nine markers placed on the subject allowed us to record the kinematics of the head, spine and pelvis segments while walking. The data were acquired and analyzed using an optical {TV-image} processor ({ELITE} system). For each locomotor trial, the walking speed as well as the absolute angular dispersions and the anchoring indexes ({AI)} of six segments around the roll and pitch axes were calculated to assess the head and trunk equilibrium strategies. A three-way repeated measures analysis of variance was used to depict differences between the walking conditions. The results showed that the walking speed was affected by the locomotion tasks (P\&lt;0.05) with values ranging from 1.10±0.21 m s−1 for natural conditions (walking forwards on a hard surface, eyes open) to 0.79±0.15 m s−1 for the most unusual conditions (walking backwards on a foam support, eyes closed). In general, walking backwards reduced the angular dispersion of the spine segments while the absolute angular dispersions of the head and pelvis did not vary significantly with any factors (P\&gt;0.05). The {AI} around the roll axis indicated good stabilization in space of the head and pelvis with high positive values and this stability increased while the subject was walking backwards on a soft surface (foam). By contrast, the spinal segments were predominantly stabilized on the underlying segment (negative {AI)}, and this stabilization even increased when the subjects walked backwards on a soft surface. Increasing the locomotion difficulty thus induced a generally rigid (‘en bloc’) functioning of the spinal segments and increased effectiveness of the head and pelvis stabilization strategies in space, especially when walking backwards on a soft surface.},

The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding ({LLE)}, an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, {LLE} maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, {LLE} is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text.},

	abstract = {In early Alzheimer's disease ({AD)}, the hippocampal region is the area most severely affected by cellular and structural alterations, yet glucose hypometabolism predominates in the posterior association cortex and posterior cingulate gyrus. One prevalent hypothesis to account for this discrepancy is that posterior cingulate hypometabolism results from disconnection from the hippocampus through disruption of the cingulum bundle. However, only partial and indirect evidence currently supports this hypothesis. Thus, using structural magnetic resonance imaging and 2-[({18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose} positron emission tomography in 18 patients with early {AD}, we assessed the relationships between hippocampal atrophy, white matter integrity, and gray matter metabolism by means of a whole-brain voxel-based correlative approach. We found that hippocampal atrophy is specifically related to cingulum bundle disruption, which is in turn highly correlated to hypometabolism of the posterior cingulate cortex but also of the middle cingulate gyrus, thalamus, mammillary bodies, parahippocampal gyrus, and hippocampus (all part of Papez's circuit), as well as the right temporoparietal associative cortex. These results provide the first direct evidence supporting the disconnection hypothesis as a major factor contributing to the early posterior hypometabolism in {AD.} Disruption of the cingulum bundle also appears to relate to hypometabolism in a large connected network over and above the posterior cingulate cortex, encompassing the whole memory circuit of Papez (consistent with the key location of this white matter tract within this loop) and also, but indirectly, the right posterior association cortex.},

	abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis as a system failure is a concept supported by the finding of consistent extramotor as well as motor cerebral pathology. The functional correlates of the structural changes detected using advanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging and voxel-based morphometry have not been extensively studied. A group of 25 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis was compared to healthy control subjects using a multi-modal neuroimaging approach comprising T(1)-weighted, diffusion-weighted and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Using probabilistic tractography, a grey matter connection network was defined based upon the prominent corticospinal tract and corpus callosum involvement demonstrated by white matter tract-based spatial statistics. This 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-specific' network included motor, premotor and supplementary motor cortices, pars opercularis and motor-related thalamic nuclei. A novel analysis protocol, using this disease-specific grey matter network as an input for a dual-regression analysis, was then used to assess changes in functional connectivity directly associated with this network. A spatial pattern of increased functional connectivity spanning sensorimotor, premotor, prefrontal and thalamic regions was found. A composite of structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging measures also allowed the qualitative discrimination of patients from controls. An integrated structural and functional connectivity approach therefore identified apparently dichotomous processes characterizing the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cerebral network failure, in which there was increased functional connectivity within regions of decreased structural connectivity. Patients with slower rates of disease progression showed connectivity measures with values closer to healthy controls, raising the possibility that functional connectivity increases might not simply represent a physiological compensation to reduced structural integrity. One alternative possibility is that increased functional connectivity reflects a progressive loss of inhibitory cortical influence as part of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pathogenesis, which might then have relevance to future therapeutic strategies.},

	volume = {81},
	abstract = {{SUMMARY:} With ideal spatial adaptation, an oracle furnishes information about how best to adapt a spatially variable estimator, whether piecewise constant, piecewise polynomial, variable knot spline, or variable bandwidth kernel, to the unknown function. Estimation with the aid of an oracle offers dramatic advantages over traditional linear estimation by nonadaptive kernels; however, it is a priori unclear whether such performance can be obtained by a procedure relying on the data alone. We describe a new principle for spatially-adaptive estimation: selective wavelet reconstruction. We show that variable-knot spline fits and piecewise-polynomial fits, when equipped with an oracle to select the knots, are not dramatically more powerful than selective wavelet reconstruction with an oracle. We develop a practical spatially adaptive method, Risk Shrink, which works by shrinkage of empirical wavelet coefficients. {RiskShrink} mimics the performance of an oracle for selective wavelet reconstruction as well as it is possible to do so. A new inequality in multivariate normal decision theory which we call the oracle inequality shows that attained performance differs from ideal performance by at most a factor of approximately 2 log n, where n is the sample size. Moreover no estimator can give a better guarantee than this. Within the class of spatially adaptive procedures, {RiskShrink} is essentially optimal. Relying only on the data, it comes within a factor log
                        2n of the performance of piecewise polynomial and variableknot spline methods equipped with an oracle. In contrast, it is unknown how or if piecewise polynomial methods could be made to function this well when denied access to an oracle and forced to rely on data alone. © 1994 Biometrika Trust.},

	abstract = {In recent work, several authors have introduced methods for sparse canonical correlation analysis (sparse {CCA).} Suppose that two sets of measurements are available on the same set of observations. Sparse {CCA} is a method for identifying sparse linear combinations of the two sets of variables that are highly correlated with each other. It has been shown to be useful in the analysis of high-dimensional genomic data, when two sets of assays are available on the same set of samples. In this paper, we propose two extensions to the sparse {CCA} methodology. (1) Sparse {CCA} is an unsupervised method; that is, it does not make use of outcome measurements that may be available for each observation (e.g., survival time or cancer subtype). We propose an extension to sparse {CCA}, which we call sparse supervised {CCA}, which results in the identification of linear combinations of the two sets of variables that are correlated with each other and associated with the outcome. (2) It is becoming increasingly common for researchers to collect data on more than two assays on the same set of samples; for instance, {SNP}, gene expression, and {DNA} copy number measurements may all be available. We develop sparse multiple {CCA} in order to extend the sparse {CCA} methodology to the case of more than two data sets. We demonstrate these new methods on simulated data and on a recently published and publicly available diffuse large B-cell lymphoma data set.},

Although white matter tractography and eigenvector color maps provide visually appealing displays of white matter tract organization, they do not easily lend themselves to quantitative and statistical analysis. In this study, a set of visual and quantitative tools for the investigation of tensor orientations in the human brain was developed. Visual tools included rose diagrams, which are spherical coordinate histograms of the major eigenvector directions, and {3D} scatterplots of the major eigenvector angles. A scatter matrix of major eigenvector directions was used to describe the distribution of major eigenvectors in a defined anatomic region. A measure of eigenvector dispersion was developed to describe the degree of eigenvector coherence in the selected region. These tools were used to evaluate directional organization and the interhemispheric symmetry of {DT-MRI} data in five healthy human brains and two patients with infiltrative diseases of the white matter tracts. In normal anatomical white matter tracts, a high degree of directional coherence and interhemispheric symmetry was observed. The infiltrative diseases appeared to alter the eigenvector properties of affected white matter tracts, showing decreased eigenvector coherence and interhemispheric symmetry. This novel approach distills the rich, {3D} information available from the diffusion tensor into a form that lends itself to quantitative analysis and statistical hypothesis testing.},

Here, we highlight the conceptual basis for the effort, the study design, and the measures available in the dataset. We focus on neuroimaging measures obtained, including T1-weighted structural neuroimaging, diffusion tensor imaging, perfusion neuroimaging using arterial spin labeling, functional imaging tasks of working memory and emotion identification, and resting state imaging of functional connectivity. Furthermore, we provide characteristics regarding the final sample acquired. Finally, we describe mechanisms in place for data sharing that will allow the {PNC} to become a freely available public resource to advance our understanding of normal and pathological brain development.},

The comparative methodology uses the Jacobian determinants derived from dense deformation fields and scaled grey-level intensity from a selected volume of interest centered on the medial temporal lobe. The {ACC} performance is assessed in a series of leave-one-out experiments aimed at separating 75 probable {AD} and 75 age-matched normal controls.

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel segmentation-based approach for fiber-tract extraction in diffusion-tensor ({DT)} images. Typical tractography methods, incorporating thresholds on fractional anisotropy and fiber curvature to terminate tracking, can face serious problems arising from partial voluming and noise. For these reasons, tractography often fails to extract thin tracts with sharp changes in orientation, e.g. the cingulum. Unlike tractography--which disregards the information in the tensors that were previously tracked--the proposed method extracts the cingulum by exploiting the statistical coherence of tensors in the entire structure. Moreover, the proposed segmentation-based method allows fuzzy class memberships to optimally extract information within partial-volumed voxels. Unlike typical fuzzy-segmentation schemes employing Gaussian models that are biased towards ellipsoidal clusters, the proposed method models the manifolds underlying the classes by incorporating nonparametric data-driven statistical models. Furthermore, it exploits the nonparametric model to capture the spatial continuity and structure of the fiber bundle. The results on real {DT} images demonstrate that the proposed method extracts the cingulum bundle significantly more accurately as compared to tractography.},

We investigated both inter- and intra-session reproducibility of perfusion {MRI} using a pulsed {ASL} ({PASL)} sequence {PICORE} {Q2TIPS} with an echo-planar imaging ({EPI)} readout. Structural {MRI} regions of interest ({ROIs)} were extracted individually by automated parcellation and segmentation methods using {FreeSurfer.} These cortical and subcortical {ROIs} were used to assess regional perfusion stability. Our results indicated regional variability in grey matter {rCBF.} Although {rCBF} measurements were characterized by intersubject variation, our results also indicated relatively less within-subject variability estimated as within-subject standard deviation ({SDW)} (intersession {SDW:} 2.0 to 8.8; intrasession {SDW:} 2.8 to 9.6) and acceptable reliabilities as measured using intraclass correlation coefficient ({ICC)} (intersession {ICC:} 0.68 to 0.94; intrasession {ICC:} 0.66 to 0.95) for regional {MRI} perfusion measurements using the {PICORE} {Q2TIPS} technique. Overall, our findings suggest that {PASL} is a technique with good within and between session reproducibility.

	abstract = {Scientists working with large volumes of high-dimensional data, such as global climate patterns, stellar spectra, or human gene distributions, regularly confront the problem of dimensionality reduction: finding meaningful low-dimensional structures hidden in their high-dimensional observations. The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs—30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 106 optic nerve fibers—a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis ({PCA)} and multidimensional scaling ({MDS)}, our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.},

	abstract = {Owning to its clinical accessibility, T1-weighted {MRI} (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) has been extensively studied in the past decades for prediction of Alzheimer's disease ({AD)} and mild cognitive impairment ({MCI).} The volumes of gray matter ({GM)}, white matter ({WM)} and cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF)} are the most commonly used measurements, resulting in many successful applications. It has been widely observed that disease-induced structural changes may not occur at isolated spots, but in several inter-related regions. Therefore, for better characterization of brain pathology, we propose in this paper a means to extract inter-regional correlation based features from local volumetric measurements. Specifically, our approach involves constructing an anatomical brain network for each subject, with each node representing a Region of Interest ({ROI)} and each edge representing Pearson correlation of tissue volumetric measurements between {ROI} pairs. As second order volumetric measurements, network features are more descriptive but also more sensitive to noise. To overcome this limitation, a hierarchy of {ROIs} is used to suppress noise at different scales. Pairwise interactions are considered not only for {ROIs} with the same scale in the same layer of the hierarchy, but also for {ROIs} across different scales in different layers. To address the high dimensionality problem resulting from the large number of network features, a supervised dimensionality reduction method is further employed to embed a selected subset of features into a low dimensional feature space, while at the same time preserving discriminative information. We demonstrate with experimental results the efficacy of this embedding strategy in comparison with some other commonly used approaches. In addition, although the proposed method can be easily generalized to incorporate other metrics of regional similarities, the benefits of using Pearson correlation in our application are reinforced by the experimental results. Without requiring new sources of information, our proposed approach improves the accuracy of {MCI} prediction from (of conventional volumetric features) to (of hierarchical network features), evaluated using data sets randomly drawn from the {ADNI} (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) dataset.},

By using models of the cortical surface and sulcal landmarks and a statistical model for gray matter density, human cortical development could be visualized across the age range in a spatiotemporally detailed time-lapse sequence. The resulting time-lapse “movies” reveal that (i) higher-order association cortices mature only after lower-order somatosensory and visual cortices, the functions of which they integrate, are developed, and (ii) phylogenetically older brain areas mature earlier than newer ones. Direct comparison with normal cortical development may help understanding of some neurodevelopmental disorders such as childhood-onset schizophrenia or autism.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel deformable model for automatic segmentation of prostates from three-dimensional ultrasound images, by statistical matching of both shape and texture. A set of Gabor-support vector machines (G-{SVMs)} are positioned on different patches of the model surface, and trained to adaptively capture texture priors of ultrasound images for differentiation of prostate and nonprostate tissues in different zones around prostate boundary. Each G-{SVM} consists of a Gabor filter bank for extraction of rotation-invariant texture features and a kernel support vector machine for robust differentiation of textures. In the deformable segmentation procedure, these pretrained G-{SVMs} are used to tentatively label voxels around the surface of deformable model as prostate or nonprostate tissues by a statistical texture matching. Subsequently, the surface of deformable model is driven to the boundary between the tentatively labeled prostate and nonprostate tissues. Since the step of tissue labeling and the step of label-based surface deformation are dependent on each other, these two steps are repeated until they converge. Experimental results by using both synthesized and real data show the good performance of the proposed model in segmenting prostates from ultrasound images. © 2006 {IEEE.}},

	abstract = {It has recently been reported (Van Dijk et al., 2011) that in-scanner head motion can have a substantial impact on {MRI} measurements of resting-state functional connectivity. This finding may be of particular relevance for studies of neurodevelopment in youth, confounding analyses to the extent that motion and subject age are related. Furthermore, while Van Dijk et al. demonstrated the effect of motion on seed-based connectivity analyses, it is not known how motion impacts other common measures of connectivity. Here we expand on the findings of Van Dijk et al. by examining the effect of motion on multiple types of resting-state connectivity analyses in a large sample of children and adolescents (n = 456). Following replication of the effect of motion on seed-based analyses, we examine the influence of motion on graphical measures of network modularity, dual-regression of independent component analysis, as well as the amplitude and fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation. In the entire sample, subject age was highly related to motion. Using a subsample where age and motion were unrelated, we demonstrate that motion has marked effects on connectivity in every analysis examined. While subject age was associated with increased within-network connectivity even when motion was accounted for, controlling for motion substantially attenuated the strength of this relationship. The results demonstrate the pervasive influence of motion on multiple types functional connectivity analysis, and underline the importance of accounting for motion in studies of neurodevelopment.},

Sparse Logistic Regression ({SLR)} addresses this issue by incorporating a sparsity penalty into the log-likelihood, which effects an automatic feature selection within the classification framework. We apply two different formulations of sparse logistic regression and compare their classification accuracy with that of Penalized Logistic Regression ({PLR)} and Maximum uncertainty Linear Discriminant Analysis ({MLDA).} In the first approach, we use the original formulation of {SLR} in which correlated voxels are forced to have similar weights. In the second approach we use a spatially regularized formulation, {SRSLR}, to force the discriminating vector to be spatially smooth when viewed as an image. Evaluation of the methods using cross-validation shows similar classification accuracies for {SLR} and {SRSLR}, with both performing better than {PLR} and {MLDA.} In addition, {SRSLR} produced classifiers that were spatially smoother than those produced by {SLR}, which may better reflect the regional effects of Alzheimer's Disease.},

Several biomarkers have been proposed to predict {AD-related} cognitive decline, initially in cases with mild cognitive impairment, and more recently in cognitively intact individuals. These early markers define at-risk individuals thought to be in the preclinical phase of {AD.} However, the clinical relevance of this preclinical phase remains controversial. The fate of such individuals, who are cognitively intact, but positive for some early {AD} biomarkers, is currently uncertain at best. In this report, we advocate the point of view that although most of these preclinical cases will evolve to clinically overt {AD}, some appear to have efficient compensatory mechanisms and virtually never develop dementia. We critically review the currently available early {AD} markers, discuss their clinical relevance, and propose a novel classification of preclinical {AD}, designating these non-progressing cases as 'stable asymptomatic cerebral amyloidosis'.},

	abstract = {In the cerebral cortex, the activity levels of neuronal populations are continuously fluctuating. When neuronal activity, as measured using functional {MRI} ({fMRI)}, is temporally coherent across 2 populations, those populations are said to be functionally connected. Functional connectivity has previously been shown to correlate with structural (anatomical) connectivity patterns at an aggregate level. In the present study we investigate, with the aid of computational modeling, whether systems-level properties of functional networks—including their spatial statistics and their persistence across time—can be accounted for by properties of the underlying anatomical network. We measured resting state functional connectivity (using {fMRI)} and structural connectivity (using diffusion spectrum imaging tractography) in the same individuals at high resolution. Structural connectivity then provided the couplings for a model of macroscopic cortical dynamics. In both model and data, we observed (i) that strong functional connections commonly exist between regions with no direct structural connection, rendering the inference of structural connectivity from functional connectivity impractical; (ii) that indirect connections and interregional distance accounted for some of the variance in functional connectivity that was unexplained by direct structural connectivity; and (iii) that resting-state functional connectivity exhibits variability within and across both scanning sessions and model runs. These empirical and modeling results demonstrate that although resting state functional connectivity is variable and is frequently present between regions without direct structural linkage, its strength, persistence, and spatial statistics are nevertheless constrained by the large-scale anatomical structure of the human cerebral cortex.},

Approximately 2/3 of the {MCI} group presented patterns of atrophy that overlapped with {AD}, whereas the remaining 1/3 overlapped with cognitively normal individuals, thereby indicating that some, but not all, {MCI} patients have significant and extensive brain atrophy in this cohort of {MCI} patients. Importantly, the group with {AD-like} patterns presented much higher rate of {MMSE} decline in follow-up visits; conversely, pattern classification provided relatively high classification accuracy (87\%) of the individuals that presented relatively higher {MMSE} decline within a year from baseline. High-dimensional pattern classification, a nonlinear multivariate analysis, provided measures of structural abnormality that can potentially be useful for individual patient classification, as well as for predicting progression and examining multivariate relationships in group analyses.},

Finding the optimal sparse expansion is known to be {NP} hard in general and non-optimal strategies such as Matching Pursuit, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit, Basis Pursuit and Basis Pursuit De-noising are often called upon. These methods show good performance in practical situations, however, they do not operate on the ℓ0 penalised cost functions that are often at the heart of the problem. In this paper we study two iterative algorithms that are minimising the cost functions of interest. Furthermore, each iteration of these strategies has computational complexity similar to a Matching Pursuit iteration, making the methods applicable to many real world problems. However, the optimisation problem is non-convex and the strategies are only guaranteed to find local solutions, so good initialisation becomes paramount. We here study two approaches. The first approach uses the proposed algorithms to refine the solutions found with other methods, replacing the typically used conjugate gradient solver. The second strategy adapts the algorithms and we show on one example that this adaptation can be used to achieve results that lie between those obtained with Matching Pursuit and those found with Orthogonal Matching Pursuit, while retaining the computational complexity of the Matching Pursuit algorithm. © 2008 Birkhäuser Boston.},

Graph theory has been used to describe cortical morphology, with networks based on covariation of gray matter volume or thickness between cortical areas across people. Here, we extend this research by proposing a new method that describes the gray matter morphology of an individual cortex as a network. In these large-scale morphological networks, nodes represent small cortical regions, and edges connect regions that have a statistically similar structure. The method was applied to a healthy sample (n = 14, scanned at 2 different time points). For all networks, we described the spatial degree distribution, average minimum path length, average clustering coefficient, small world property, and betweenness centrality ({BC).} Finally, we studied the reproducibility of all these properties. The networks showed more clustering than random networks and a similar minimum path length, indicating that they were “small world.” The spatial degree and {BC} distributions corresponded closely to those from group-derived networks. All network property values were reproducible over the 2 time points examined. Our results demonstrate that intracortical similarities can be used to provide a robust statistical description of individual gray matter morphology.},

	abstract = {Three hundred forty-two subjects underwent 428 research lumbar punctures for studies of cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF)} biomarkers. Subjects were 67 Alzheimer disease or mild cognitive impairment ({AD/MCI)} patients and 275 cognitively normal adults aged 21 to 88. Lumbar puncture was performed in the lateral decubitus or sitting position using the Sprotte 24 g atraumatic spinal needle. Up to 34 ml of cerebrospinal fluid were collected. Anxiety and pain experienced during lumbar puncture were rated on a visual analog scale. The frequency of any adverse event (11.7\%), clinically significant adverse events (3.97\%), and typical post-lumbar puncture headache ({PLPHA)} (0.93\%) was low. Risk of post-lumbar puncture headache was unrelated to age, gender, position during lumbar puncture, ml of cerebrospinal fluid collected, or minutes of recumbent rest following lumbar puncture. The frequency of post-lumbar puncture headache was lower in {AD/MCI} (P = 0.03) than any other subject group. Anxiety and pain ratings were low. Younger subjects reported more anxiety than old (P = 0.001) and {AD/MCI} subjects (P = 0.008) and more pain than older normal subjects (P = 0.013). Pain ratings for women were higher than those for men (P = 0.006). Using the Sprotte 24 g spinal needle, research lumbar puncture can be performed with a very low rate of clinically significant adverse events and with good acceptability in cognitively impaired persons and cognitively normal adults of all ages.},

	abstract = {Several recent reports in large, independent samples have demonstrated the influence of motion artifact on resting-state functional connectivity {MRI} (rsfc-{MRI).} Standard rsfc-{MRI} preprocessing typically includes regression of confounding signals and band-pass filtering. However, substantial heterogeneity exists in how these techniques are implemented across studies, and no prior study has examined the effect of differing approaches for the control of motion-induced artifacts. To better understand how in-scanner head motion affects rsfc-{MRI} data, we describe the spatial, temporal, and spectral characteristics of motion artifacts in a sample of 348 adolescents. Analyses utilize a novel approach for describing head motion on a voxelwise basis. Next, we systematically evaluate the efficacy of a range of confound regression and filtering techniques for the control of motion-induced artifacts. Results reveal that the effectiveness of preprocessing procedures on the control of motion is heterogeneous, and that improved preprocessing provides a substantial benefit beyond typical procedures. These results demonstrate that the effect of motion on rsfc-{MRI} can be substantially attenuated through improved preprocessing procedures, but not completely removed.},

The development of fastest repetitive voluntary motor activity was assessed for 3 different types of movements including fastest repetitive tapping movements, aiming movements and a pegboard transportation task. These 3 motor activities were chosen as they were different as to their dependence on detailed sensory guidance. Despite these differences the speed of all 3 movements showed a very similar developmental profile, which was matched, however, by the developmental slope of the fastest cortico-motoneuronal efferents. Hence the development of central conduction times determines the speed of repetitive movements in children. In contrast, we could not observe significant effects of repetitive training on speed of these movements. We show for the first time that the development of fastest voluntary movements is a structure-bound phenomenon, being independent from learning.},

Connection-wise statistical analysis, as well as analysis of regional and global network measures, presented a comprehensive description of network characteristics. In all supratentorial regions, males had greater within-hemispheric connectivity, as well as enhanced modularity and transitivity, whereas between-hemispheric connectivity and cross-module participation predominated in females. However, this effect was reversed in the cerebellar connections. Analysis of these changes developmentally demonstrated differences in trajectory between males and females mainly in adolescence and in adulthood. Overall, the results suggest that male brains are structured to facilitate connectivity between perception and coordinated action, whereas female brains are designed to facilitate communication between analytical and intuitive processing modes.},

Compared with pattern classification studies, pattern regression considers the problem of estimating continuous rather than categorical variables, and can be more challenging. It is also clinically important, since it can be used to estimate disease stage and predict clinical progression from images. In this work, adaptive regional feature extraction approach is used along with other common feature extraction methods, and feature selection technique is adopted to produce a small number of discriminative features for optimal regression performance. Then the Relevance Vector Machine ({RVM)} is used to build regression models based on selected features. To get stable regression models from limited training samples, a bagging framework is adopted to build ensemble basis regressors derived from multiple bootstrap training samples, and thus to alleviate the effects of outliers as well as facilitate the optimal model parameter selection. Finally, this regression scheme is tested on simulated data and real data via cross-validation. Experimental results demonstrate that this regression scheme achieves higher estimation accuracy and better generalizing ability than Support Vector Regression ({SVR).}},

Since it is difficult to estimate the exact partial correlation under the small-n large-p situation, a sparseness constraint is generally introduced. In this paper, we consider the sparse linear regression model with a l1-norm penalty, also known as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ({LASSO)}, for estimating sparse brain connectivity. {LASSO} is a well-known decoding algorithm in the compressed sensing ({CS).} The {CS} theory states that {LASSO} can reconstruct the exact sparse signal even from a small set of noisy measurements. We briefly show that the penalized linear regression for partial correlation estimation is related to {CS.} It opens a new possibility that the proposed framework can be used for a sparse brain network recovery. As an illustration, we construct sparse brain networks of 97 regions of interest ({ROIs)} obtained from {FDG-PET} imaging data for the autism spectrum disorder ({ASD)} children and the pediatric control ({PedCon)} subjects. As validation, we check the network reproducibilities by leave-one-out cross validation and compare the clustered structures derived from the brain networks of {ASD} and {PedCon.}},

	abstract = {We describe a method for recovering the underlying parametrization of scattered data (mi) lying on a manifold M embedded in high-dimensional Euclidean space. The method, Hessian-based locally linear embedding, derives from a conceptual framework of local isometry in which the manifold M, viewed as a Riemannian submanifold of the ambient Euclidean space ℝn, is locally isometric to an open, connected subset Θ of Euclidean space ℝd. Because Θ does not have to be convex, this framework is able to handle a significantly wider class of situations than the original {ISOMAP} algorithm. The theoretical framework revolves around a quadratic form ℋ(f) = {∫M} {∥Hf(m)∥dm} defined on functions f : M ↦ ℝ. Here Hf denotes the Hessian of f, and ℋ(f) averages the Frobenius norm of the Hessian over M. To define the Hessian, we use orthogonal coordinates on the tangent planes of M. The key observation is that, if M truly is locally isometric to an open, connected subset of ℝd, then ℋ(f) has a (d + 1)-dimensional null space consisting of the constant functions and a d-dimensional space of functions spanned by the original isometric coordinates. Hence, the isometric coordinates can be recovered up to a linear isometry. Our method may be viewed as a modification of locally linear embedding and our theoretical framework as a modification of the Laplacian eigenmaps framework, where we substitute a quadratic form based on the Hessian in place of one based on the Laplacian.},

There is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition rely on such representations. But little is known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

As a generalization of the nonnegative matrix factorization, the proposed method aims to approximate a collection of diffusion tensor images using nonnegative linear combinations of basis tensor images. An efficient iterative optimization algorithm is proposed to solve this factorization problem. We present two applications: the {DTI} segmentation problem and a novel approach to discover informative and common parts in a collection of diffusion tensor images. The proposed method has been validated using both synthetic and real data, and experimental results have shown that it offers a competitive alternative to current state-of-the-arts in terms of accuracy and efficiency.},

	abstract = {An algorithm is proposed for the reconstruction of a sparse spike train from an incomplete set of its Fourier components. It is shown that as little as 20-25\% of the Fourier spectrum is sufficient in practice for a high-quality reconstruction. The method employs linear programming to minimize the L1-norm of the output, because minimization of this norm favors solutions with isolated spikes. Given a wavelet, this technique can be used to perform deconvolution of noisy seismograms when the desired output is a sparse spike series. Relative reliability of the data is assessed in the frequency domain, and only the reliable spectral data are included in the calculation of the spike series. Equations for the unknown spike amplitudes are solved to an accuracy compatible with the uncertainties in the reliable data. In examples with 10\% random noise, the output is superior to that obtained using conventional least-squares techniques. -Authors},

Thickness is then defined in terms of a distance measure between the interfaces of this sheet like structure. This technique also provides a natural way to compute continuous estimates of thickness within buried sulci by preventing opposing gray matter banks from intersecting.

	abstract = {Purpose To develop quantitative cerebral blood flow ({CBF)} imaging using pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling ({PCASL)} in swine, accounting for their cerebrovascular anatomy and physiology. Materials and Methods Five domestic pigs (2.5–3 months, 25 kg) were used in these studies. The orientation of the labeled arteries, T1bl, M0bl, and T1gm were measured in swine. Labeling parameters were tuned with respect to blood velocity to optimize labeling efficiency based on the data collected from three subjects. Finally, {CBF} and arterial transit time ({ATT)} maps for two subjects were created from {PCASL} data to determine global averages. Results The average labeling efficiency over measured velocities of 5–18 cm/s was 0.930. The average T1bl was 1546 ms, the average T1gm was 1224 ms, and the average blood-to-white matter ratio of M0 was 1.25, which was used to find M0bl. The global averages over the subjects were 54.05 {mL/100} g tissue/min {CBF} and 1261 ms {ATT.} Conclusion This study demonstrates the feasibility of {PCASL} for {CBF} quantification in swine. Quantification of {CBF} using {PCASL} in swine can be further developed as an accessible and cost-effective model of human cerebral perfusion for investigating injuries that affect blood flow. J.

Here we synthesize past observations to provide strong evidence that the default network is a specific, anatomically defined brain system preferentially active when individuals are not focused on the external environment. Analysis of connectional anatomy in the monkey supports the presence of an interconnected brain system. Providing insight into function, the default network is active when individuals are engaged in internally focused tasks including autobiographical memory retrieval, envisioning the future, and conceiving the perspectives of others. Probing the functional anatomy of the network in detail reveals that it is best understood as multiple interacting subsystems. The medial temporal lobe subsystem provides information from prior experiences in the form of memories and associations that are the building blocks of mental simulation. The medial prefrontal subsystem facilitates the flexible use of this information during the construction of self-relevant mental simulations. These two subsystems converge on important nodes of integration including the posterior cingulate cortex. The implications of these functional and anatomical observations are discussed in relation to possible adaptive roles of the default network for using past experiences to plan for the future, navigate social interactions, and maximize the utility of moments when we are not otherwise engaged by the external world. We conclude by discussing the relevance of the default network for understanding mental disorders including autism, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease.},

	abstract = {{CONTEXT}

Several neurobiological models of obsessive-compulsive disorder ({OCD)} posit a primary role for dysfunction of the anterior cingulate gyrus. Both functional and structural neuroimaging studies have implicated anterior cingulate gray matter abnormalities in the pathophysiology of {OCD}, but there has been little investigation of the anterior cingulate white matter in this disorder.


{OBJECTIVE}

To test the hypothesis that patients with {OCD} have abnormal white matter microstructure in the anterior cingulate gyrus compared with healthy volunteers as inferred from diffusion tensor imaging. Additional analyses examined group differences in white matter integrity across the entire brain.


{DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PARTICIPANTS}

Fifteen patients with a {DSM-IV} diagnosis of {OCD} and 15 healthy volunteers matched for age, sex, and handedness underwent diffusion tensor imaging and structural magnetic resonance imaging examinations. Fractional anisotropy ({FA)}, a robust intravoxel measure of water self-diffusion, was compared between groups on a voxel-by-voxel basis in the anterior cingulate white matter after standardization in Talairach space.


{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}

Clinical ratings of symptom severity (ie, Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale) and {FA.}


{RESULTS}

Compared with healthy volunteers, patients demonstrated significantly lower {FA} bilaterally in 3 areas of the anterior cingulate gyrus white matter. Additional analyses conducted across the rest of the brain white matter revealed lower {FA} bilaterally in the parietal region (supramarginal gyri), right posterior cingulate gyrus, and left occipital lobe (lingual gyrus). No areas of significantly higher {FA} were observed in patients compared with healthy volunteers. Lower {FA} in the parietal region correlated significantly with higher Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale scores.


{CONCLUSIONS}

These preliminary findings provide evidence of an abnormality that involves the anterior cingulate white matter in the pathogenesis of {OCD} and are consistent with neurobiological models that posit a defect in connectivity in the anterior cingulate basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit. White matter abnormalities in other brain regions may also be implicated in the neurobiology of {OCD.}},

However, the interpretation of graph alterations remains unclear, because the definition of connectivity depends on the imaging modality used. Here we examined which graph properties have been consistently reported to be disturbed in {AD} studies, using a heuristically defined “graph space” to investigate which theoretical models can best explain graph alterations in {AD.} Findings from structural and functional graphs point to a loss of highly connected areas in {AD.} However, studies showed considerable variability in reported group differences of most graph properties. This suggests that brain graphs might not be isometric, which complicates the interpretation of graph measurements. We highlight confounding factors such as differences in graph construction methods and provide recommendations for future research.},

Alzheimer disease ({AD)} and frontotemporal lobar degeneration ({FTLD)} may have overlapping clinical presentations despite distinct underlying neuropathologies, thus making in vivo diagnosis challenging. In this study, we evaluate the utility of {MRI} as a noninvasive screening procedure for the differential diagnosis of {AD} and {FTLD.}


{METHODS}

We recruited 185 patients with a clinically diagnosed neurodegenerative disease consistent with {AD} or {FTLD} who had a lumbar puncture and a volumetric {MRI.} A subset of 32 patients had genetic or autopsy-confirmed {AD} or {FTLD.} We used singular value decomposition to decompose {MRI} volumes and linear regression and cross-validation to predict {CSF} total tau (tt) and β-amyloid (Aβ(1-42)) ratio ({tt/Aβ)} in patients with {AD} and patients with {FTLD.} We then evaluated accuracy of {MRI-based} predicted {tt/Aβ} using 4 converging sources including neuroanatomic visualization and categorization of a subset of patients with genetic or autopsy-confirmed {AD} or {FTLD.}


{RESULTS}

Regression analyses showed that {MRI-predicted} {tt/Aβ} is highly related to actual {CSF} {tt/Aβ.} In each group, both predicted and actual {CSF} {tt/Aβ} have extensively overlapping neuroanatomic correlates: low {tt/Aβ} consistent with {FTLD} is related to ventromedial prefrontal regions while high {tt/Aβ} consistent with {AD} is related to posterior cortical regions. {MRI-predicted} {tt/Aβ} is 75\% accurate at identifying underlying diagnosis in patients with known pathology and in clinically diagnosed patients with known {CSF} {tt/Aβ} levels.

{MRI} may serve as a noninvasive procedure that can screen for {AD} and {FTLD} pathology as a surrogate for {CSF} biomarkers.},

The geometric feature is derived from the structural geometry of diffusion and characterizes the shape of the tensor in terms of prolateness, oblateness, and sphericity of the tensor. Local spatial distributions of the prolate, oblate, and spherical geometry are used to create an attribute vector of geometric feature for matching. The orientation feature improves the matching of the {WM} fiber tracts by taking into account the statistical information of underlying fiber orientations. These features are incorporated into a hierarchical deformable registration framework to develop a diffusion tensor image registration algorithm. Extensive experiments on simulated and real brain {DT} data establish the superiority of this algorithm for deformable matching of diffusion tensors, thereby aiding in atlas creation. The robustness of the method makes it potentially useful for group-based analysis of {DT} images acquired in large studies to identify disease-induced and developmental changes.},

{DESIGN}

Images were quantified using a region-of-interest approach and voxel-based morphometry analysis. We used a high-dimensional pattern classification approach to delineate brain regions that collectively formed the Spatial Pattern of Abnormalities for Recognition of {PDD.}


{SETTING}

The Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders Center at the University of Pennsylvania.


{SUBJECTS}

Eighty-four {PD} patients (61 {PD-NC}, 12 {PD-MCI}, and 11 {PDD)} and 23 healthy control subjects ({HCs)} underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the brain.


{RESULTS}

The {PD-NC} patients did not demonstrate significant brain atrophy compared with {HCs.} Compared with {PD-NC} patients, {PD-MCI} patients had hippocampal atrophy (β = -0.37; P = .001), and {PDD} patients demonstrated hippocampal (β = -0.32; P = .004) and additional medial temporal lobe atrophy (β = -0.36; P = .003). The {PD-MCI} patients had a different pattern of atrophy compared with {PD-NC} patients (P = .04) and a similar pattern to that of {PDD} patients (P = .81), characterized by hippocampal, prefrontal cortex gray and white matter, occipital lobe gray and white matter, and parietal lobe white matter atrophy. In nondemented {PD} patients, there was a correlation between memory-encoding performance and hippocampal volume.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Hippocampal atrophy is a biomarker of initial cognitive decline in {PD}, including impaired memory encoding and storage, suggesting heterogeneity in the neural substrate of memory impairment. Use of a pattern classification approach may allow identification of diffuse regions of cortical gray and white matter atrophy early in the course of cognitive decline.},

	abstract = {Four-dimensional computed tomography ({4D-CT)} plays an important role in lung cancer treatment because of its capability in providing a comprehensive characterization of respiratory motion for high-precision radiation therapy. However, due to the inherent high-dose exposure associated with {CT}, dense sampling along superior–inferior direction is often not practical, thus resulting in an inter-slice thickness that is much greater than in-plane voxel resolutions. As a consequence, artifacts such as lung vessel discontinuity and partial volume effects are often observed in {4D-CT} images, which may mislead dose administration in radiation therapy. In this paper, we present a novel patch-based technique for resolution enhancement of {4D-CT} images along the superior–inferior direction. Our working premise is that anatomical information that is missing in one particular phase can be recovered from other phases. Based on this assumption, we employ a hierarchical patch-based sparse representation mechanism to enhance the superior–inferior resolution of {4D-CT} by reconstructing additional intermediate {CT} slices. Specifically, for each spatial location on an intermediate {CT} slice that we intend to reconstruct, we first agglomerate a dictionary of patches from images of all other phases in the {4D-CT.} We then employ a sparse combination of patches from this dictionary, with guidance from neighboring (upper and lower) slices, to reconstruct a series of patches, which we progressively refine in a hierarchical fashion to reconstruct the final intermediate slices with significantly enhanced anatomical details. Our method was extensively evaluated using a public dataset. In all experiments, our method outperforms the conventional linear and cubic-spline interpolation methods in preserving image details and also in suppressing misleading artifacts, indicating that our proposed method can potentially be applied to better image-guided radiation therapy of lung cancer- in the future.},

Challenging the prevailing myth -- heralded by the national media, Head Start, and the White House -- that the most crucial brain development occurs between birth and age three, Bruer explains why relying on the zero to three standard threatens a child's mental and emotional well-being far more than missing a few sessions of toddler gymnastics. Too many parents, educators, and government funding agencies, he says, see these years as our main opportunity to shape a child's future. Bruer agrees that valid scientific studies do support the existence of critical periods in brain development, but he painstakingly shows that these same brain studies prove that learning and cognitive development occur throughout childhood and, indeed, one's entire life. Making hard science comprehensible for all readers, Bruer marshals the neurological and psychological evidence to show that children and adults have been hardwired for lifelong learning. Parents have been sold a bill of goods that is highly destructive because it overemphasizes infant and toddler nurturing to the detriment of long-term parental and educational responsibilities. The Myth of the First Three Years is a bold and controversial book because it urges parents and decision-makers alike to consider and debate for themselves the evidence for lifelong learning opportunities. But more than anything, this book spreads a message of hope: while there are no quick fixes, conscientious parents and committed educators can make a difference in every child's life, from infancy through childhood, and beyond.},

	title = {Supervised nonlinear dimensionality reduction for visualization and classification},
	volume = {35},
	abstract = {When performing visualization and classification, people often confront the problem of dimensionality reduction. Isomap is one of the most promising nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques. However, when Isomap is applied to real-world data, it shows some limitations, such as being sensitive to noise. In this paper, an improved version of Isomap, namely S-Isomap, is proposed. S-Isomap utilizes class information to guide the procedure of nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Such a kind of procedure is called supervised nonlinear dimensionality reduction. In S-Isomap, the neighborhood graph of the input data is constructed according to a certain kind of dissimilarity between data points, which is specially designed to integrate the class information. The dissimilarity has several good properties which help to discover the true neighborhood of the data and, thus, makes S-Isomap a robust technique for both visualization and classification, especially for real-world problems. In the visualization experiments, S-Isomap is compared with Isomap, {LLE}, and {WeightedIso.} The results show that S-Isomap performs the best. In the classification experiments, S-Isomap is used as a preprocess of classification and compared with Isomap, {WeightedIso}, as well as some other well-established classification methods, including the K-nearest neighbor classifier, {BP} neural network, J4.8 decision tree, and {SVM.} The results reveal that S-Isomap excels compared to Isomap and {WeightedIso} in classification, and it is highly competitive with those well-known classification methods. © 2005 {IEEE.}},

{METHODS:} We included 21 patients with {FTD}, 24 patients with {AD}, and 25 {CN} subjects in this cross-sectional {MRI} study. All subjects had {MRI} scans including T1-weighted structural images and {ASL-MR} images.
{RESULTS:} {ASL-MRI} detected a pattern of hypoperfusion in right frontal regions in patients with {FTD} vs {CN} subjects, similar to {PET} and {SPECT.} {FTD} had higher perfusion than {AD} in the parietal regions and posterior cingulate. Frontal hypoperfusion in {FTD} correlated with deficits in judgment and problem solving. Adding frontal perfusion to gray matter ({GM)} atrophy significantly improved the classification of {FTD} from normal aging to 74\%, and adding parietal perfusion to {GM} atrophy significantly improved the classification of {FTD} from {AD} to 75\%. Combining frontal and parietal lobe perfusion further improved the classification of {FTD} from {AD} to 87\%.
{CONCLUSION:} Frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer disease display different spatial distributions of hypoperfusion on arterial spin labeling {MRI.} With further development and evaluation, arterial spin labeling {MRI} could contribute to the differential diagnosis between frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer disease.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To assess the extent to which multiple Alzheimer disease ({AD)} biomarkers improve the ability to predict future decline in subjects with mild cognitive impairment ({MCI)} compared with predictions based on clinical parameters alone.
Materials and Methods: All protocols were approved by the institutional review board at each site, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The study was {HIPAA} compliant. Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ({ADNI)} baseline magnetic resonance ({MR)} imaging and fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose ({FDG)} positron emission tomography ({PET)} studies for 97 subjects with {MCI} were used. {MR} imaging–derived gray matter probability maps and {FDG} {PET} images were analyzed by using independent component analysis, an unbiased data-driven method to extract independent sources of information from whole-brain data. The loading parameters for all {MR} imaging and {FDG} components, along with cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF)} proteins, were entered into logistic regression models (dependent variable: conversion to {AD} within 4 years). Eight models were considered, including all combinations of {MR} imaging, {PET}, and {CSF} markers with the covariates (age, education, apolipoprotein E genotype, Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale score).
Results: Combining {MR} imaging, {FDG} {PET}, and {CSF} data with routine clinical tests significantly increased the accuracy of predicting conversion to {AD} compared with clinical testing alone. The misclassification rate decreased from 41.3\% to 28.4\% (P {\textless} .00001). {FDG} {PET} contributed more information to routine tests (P {\textless} .00001) than {CSF} (P = .32) or {MR} imaging (P = .08).
Conclusion: Imaging and {CSF} biomarkers can improve prediction of conversion from {MCI} to {AD} compared with baseline clinical testing. {FDG} {PET} appears to add the greatest prognostic information. © {RSNA}, 2012 Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.12120010/-{/DC1}},

	abstract = {Classical dictionary learning algorithms ({DLA)} allow unicomponent signals to be processed. Due to our interest in two-dimensional ({2D)} motion signals, we wanted to mix the two components to provide rotation invariance. So, multicomponent frameworks are examined here. In contrast to the well-known multichannel framework, a multivariate framework is first introduced as a tool to easily solve our problem and to preserve the data structure. Within this multivariate framework, we then present sparse coding methods: multivariate orthogonal matching pursuit (M-{OMP)}, which provides sparse approximation for multivariate signals, and multivariate {DLA} (M-{DLA)}, which empirically learns the characteristic patterns (or features) that are associated to a multivariate signals set, and combines shift-invariance and online learning. Once the multivariate dictionary is learned, any signal of this considered set can be approximated sparsely. This multivariate framework is introduced to simply present the {2D} rotation invariant ({2DRI)} case. By studying {2D} motions that are acquired in bivariate real signals, we want the decompositions to be independent of the orientation of the movement execution in the {2D} space. The methods are thus specified for the {2DRI} case to be robust to any rotation: {2DRI-OMP} and {2DRI-DLA.} Shift and rotation invariant cases induce a compact learned dictionary and provide robust decomposition. As validation, our methods are applied to {2D} handwritten data to extract the elementary features of this signals set, and to provide rotation invariant decomposition.},

	abstract = {Scientists working with large volumes of high-dimensional data, such as global climate patterns, stellar spectra, or human gene distributions, regularly confront the problem of dimensionality reduction: finding meaningful low-dimensional structures hidden in their high-dimensional observations. The human Brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs - 30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 106 optic nerve fibers - a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis ({PCA)} and multidimensional scaling ({MDS)}, our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.},

A {3D} realistic mesoscale model of the cortical capillary network (non-tree like) is constructed using a random Voronoi tessellation in which each edge represents a capillary segment. The hemodynamics and oxygen transport are numerically simulated in the model, which involves rheological laws in the capillaries, oxygen diffusion, and non-linear binding of oxygen to hemoglobin, respectively. The findings show that the cerebral hypoxia due to a significant decreased perfusion (as can occur in stroke) can be avoided by a moderate reduction in oxygen demand. Oxygen extraction fraction ({OEF)} can be an important indicator for the brain oxygen metabolism under normal perfusion and misery-perfusion syndrome (leading to ischemia). The results demonstrated that a disproportionately large increase in blood supply is required for a small increase in the oxygen demand, which, in turn, is strongly dependent on the resting {OEF.} The predicted flow-metabolism coupling in the model supports the experimental studies of spatiotemporal stimulations in humans by positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging.},

	abstract = {Joint tissues are exquisitely sensitive to their mechanical environment, and mechanical loading may be the most important external factor regulating the development and long-term maintenance of joint tissues. Moderate mechanical loading maintains the integrity of articular cartilage; however, both disuse and overuse can result in cartilage degradation. The irreversible destruction of cartilage is the hallmark of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. In these instances of cartilage breakdown, inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha stimulate the production of matrix metalloproteinases ({MMPs)} and aggrecanases ({ADAMTSs)}, enzymes that can degrade components of the cartilage extracellular matrix. In order to prevent cartilage destruction, tremendous effort has been expended to design inhibitors of {MMP/ADAMTS} activity and/or synthesis. To date, however, no effective clinical inhibitors exist. Accumulating evidence suggests that physiologic joint loading helps maintain cartilage integrity; however, the mechanisms by which these mechanical stimuli regulate joint homeostasis are still being elucidated. Identifying mechanosensitive chondroprotective pathways may reveal novel targets or therapeutic strategies in preventing cartilage destruction in joint disease.},

	abstract = {Laboratory studies have suggested that the preferred cadence of walking is ∼120 steps/min, and the vertical acceleration of the head exhibits a dominant peak at this step frequency (2 Hz). These studies have been limited to short periods of walking along a predetermined path or on a treadmill, and whether such a highly tuned frequency of movement can be generalized to all forms of locomotion in a natural setting is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine whether humans exhibit a preferred cadence during extended periods of uninhibited locomotor activity and whether this step frequency is consistent with that observed in laboratory studies. Head linear acceleration was measured over a 10-h period in 20 subjects during the course of a day, which encompassed a broad range of locomotor (walking, running, cycling) and nonlocomotor (working at a desk, driving a car, riding a bus or subway) activities. Here we show a highly tuned resonant frequency of human locomotion at 2 Hz ({SD} 0.13) with no evidence of correlation with gender, age, height, weight, or body mass index. This frequency did not differ significantly from the preferred step frequency observed in the seminal laboratory study of Murray et al. (Murray {MP}, Drought {AB}, and Kory {RC.} J Bone Joint Surg {46A:} 335–360, 1964). [1.95 Hz ({SD} 0.19)]. On the basis of the frequency characteristics of otolith-spinal reflexes, which drive lower body movement via the lateral vestibulospinal tract, and otolith-mediated collic and ocular reflexes that maintain gaze when walking, we speculate that this spontaneous tempo of locomotion represents some form of central “resonant frequency” of human movement.},

	abstract = {The mitochondrion is at the core of cellular energy metabolism, being the site of most {ATP} generation. Calcium is a key regulator of mitochondrial function and acts at several levels within the organelle to stimulate {ATP} synthesis. However, the dysregulation of mitochondrial Ca(2+) homeostasis is now recognized to play a key role in several pathologies. For example, mitochondrial matrix Ca(2+) overload can lead to enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species, triggering of the permeability transition pore, and cytochrome c release, leading to apoptosis. Despite progress regarding the independent roles of both Ca(2+) and mitochondrial dysfunction in disease, the molecular mechanisms by which Ca(2+) can elicit mitochondrial dysfunction remain elusive. This review highlights the delicate balance between the positive and negative effects of Ca(2+) and the signaling events that perturb this balance. Overall, a "two-hit" hypothesis is developed, in which Ca(2+) plus another pathological stimulus can bring about mitochondrial dysfunction.},

In particular, we review what is known about the shape of the image of input space under the feature space map, and how this influences the capacity of {SV} methods. Following this, we describe how the metric governing the intrinsic geometry of the mapped surface can be computed in terms of the kernel, using the example of the class of inhomogeneous polynomial kernels, which are often used in {SV} pattern recognition. We then discuss the connection between feature space and input space by dealing with the question of how one can, given some vector in feature space, find a preimage (exact or approximate) in input space. We describe algorithms to tackle this issue, and show their utility in two applications of kernel methods. First, we use it to reduce the computational complexity of {SV} decision functions; second, we combine it with the Kernel {PCA} algorithm, thereby constructing a nonlinear statistical denoising technique which is shown to perform well on real-world data.},

	abstract = {We develop a face recognition algorithm which is insensitive to large variation in lighting direction and facial expression. Taking a pattern classification approach, we consider each pixel in an image as a coordinate in a high-dimensional space. We take advantage of the observation that the images of a particular face, under varying illumination but fixed pose, lie in a {3D} linear subspace of the high dimensional image space-if the face is a Lambertian surface without shadowing. However, since faces are not truly Lambertian surfaces and do indeed produce self-shadowing, images will deviate from this linear subspace. Rather than explicitly modeling this deviation, we linearly project the image into a subspace in a manner which discounts those regions of the face with large deviation. Our projection method is based on Fisher's Linear Discriminant and produces well separated classes in a low-dimensional subspace, even under severe variation in lighting and facial expressions. The Eigenface technique, another method based on linearly projecting the image space to a low dimensional subspace, has similar computational requirements. Yet, extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed {"Fisherface"} method has error rates that are lower than those of the Eigenface technique for tests on the Harvard and Yale Face Databases. ©1997 {IEEE.}},

We also develop a new strategy for selecting the most informative {MCI} subjects. We evaluate the performance of our approach on 202 subjects with all three modalities of data ({MRI}, {FDG-PET} and {CSF)} from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ({ADNI)} database. The experimental results show that our {SM-RVR} method achieves a root-mean-square error ({RMSE)} of 1.91 and a correlation coefficient ({CORR)} of 0.80 for estimating the {MMSE} scores, and also a {RMSE} of 4.45 and a {CORR} of 0.78 for estimating the {ADAS-Cog} scores, demonstrating very promising performances in {AD} studies.},

Significant differences between males and females exist in many aspects like size, color, body shapes, and weight. In this research, we characterize and analyze the sexual dimorphism in human face as a function of age and of face features. Features are grouped into six categories: head, eyes, orbits, nose, lips, and mouth, and ears. We demonstrate that the face of adult males is significantly different from adult females.

We illustrate this concept by an analogy with Maxwell's demons. We show that this concept relates to more traditional ones, based on attraction, with an intermediate step being optical flow techniques. We use the concept of diffusing models to derive three different non-rigid matching algorithms, one using all the intensity levels in the static image, one using only contour points, and a last one operating on already segmented images. Finally, we present results with synthesized deformations and real medical images, with applications to heart motion tracking and three-dimensional inter-patients matching.},

The goal is to transform very high-dimensional input (typically, millions of voxels) to a low-dimensional representation (small number of constructed features) that preserves discriminative signal and is clinically interpretable. We formulate the task as a constrained optimization problem that combines generative and discriminative objectives and show how to extend it to the semi-supervised learning ({SSL)} setting. We propose a novel large-scale algorithm to solve the resulting optimization problem. In the fully supervised case, we demonstrate accuracy rates that are better than or comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms on several datasets while producing a representation of the group difference that is consistent with prior clinical reports. Effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for {SSL} is evaluated with both benchmark and medical imaging datasets. In the benchmark datasets, the results are better than or comparable to the state-of-the-art methods for {SSL.} For evaluation of the {SSL} setting in medical datasets, we use images of subjects with mild cognitive impairment ({MCI)}, which is believed to be a precursor to Alzheimer's disease ({AD)}, as unlabeled data. {AD} subjects and normal control ({NC)} subjects are used as labeled data, and we try to predict conversion from {MCI} to {AD} on follow-up. The semi-supervised extension of this method not only improves the generalization accuracy for the labeled data ({AD/NC)} slightly but is also able to predict subjects which are likely to converge to {AD.} © 2011 {IEEE.}},

These classifiers are arranged into a cascade structure in order to optimise overall recognition performance. Furthermore, it is shown how performance can be further improved by first classifying the gender of the face images using an {SVM} trained in a similar manner. Both gender-specific expression classification and expression-specific gender classification cascades are considered, with the former yielding better recognition performance.

Further, it is believed that the spatial resolution of non-invasive brain imaging modalities is not sufficient to isolate neural activity related to individual muscles. However, this study shows that it is possible to reconstruct muscle activity from functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI).} We simultaneously recorded surface electromyography ({EMG)} from two antagonist muscles and motor cortices activity using {fMRI}, during an isometric task requiring both reciprocal activation and co-activation of the wrist muscles. Bayesian sparse regression was used to identify the parameters of a linear mapping from the {fMRI} activity in areas 4 (M1) and 6 (pre-motor, {SMA)} to {EMG}, and to reconstruct muscle activity in an independent test data set. The mapping obtained by the sparse regression algorithm showed significantly better generalization than those obtained from algorithms commonly used in decoding, i.e., support vector machine and least square regression. The two voxel sets corresponding to the activity of the antagonist muscles were intermingled but disjoint. They were distributed over a wide area of pre-motor cortex and M1 and not limited to regions generally associated with wrist control. These results show that brain activity measured by {fMRI} in humans can be used to predict individual muscle activity through Bayesian linear models, and that our algorithm provides a novel and non-invasive tool to investigate the brain mechanisms involved in motor control and learning in humans.},

Therefore, for the directional textures, it is essential to calculate the wavelet features along a specific direction. In the proposed approach, the Radon transform is first employed to detect the principal direction of the texture. Then, the texture is rotated to place its principal direction at 0 degrees. A wavelet transform is applied to the rotated image to extract texture features. This approach provides a features space with small intraclass variability and, therefore, good separation between different classes. The performance of the method is evaluated using three texture sets. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed approach compared with some existing methods.},

Image examinations are done three years apart and consist of {3D} high-resolution anatomical images, low resolution tensor-valued {DTI} recordings and {4D} resting state {fMRI} time series. The integrated analysis of the data requires robust tools for segmentation, registration and fiber tracking, which we combine in an automated manner. Our automated workflow is strongly desired due to the large number of subjects. Especially, we introduce the use of histogram segmentation to processed {fMRI} data to obtain functionally important seed and target regions for fiber tracking between them. This enables analysis of individually important resting state networks. We also discuss various approaches for the assessment of white matter integrity parameters along tracts, and in particular we introduce the use of functional data analysis ({FDA)} for this task.},

Thus, changes of the corpus callosum ({CC)} may reflect various aspects of {HD} pathogenesis. We recruited 17 {HD} patients, 17 pre-{HD} subjects, and 34 healthy age-matched controls. Three-dimensional anatomical {MRI} and diffusion tensor images of the brain were acquired on a {3T} scanner. Combining region-of-interest analyses, voxel-based morphometry, and tract-based spatial statistics, we investigated callosal thickness, {WM} density, fractional anisotropy, and radial and axial diffusivities. Compared with controls, pre-{HD} subjects showed reductions of the isthmus, likely due to myelin damage. Compared with pre-{HD} subjects, {HD} patients showed reductions of isthmus and body, with axonal damage confined to the body. Compared with controls, {HD} patients had significantly decreased callosal measures in extended regions across almost the entire {CC.} At this disease stage, both myelin and axonal damage are detectable. Supplementary multiple regression analyses revealed that {WM} reduction density in the isthmus as well as Disease Burden scores allowed to predict the {"HD} development" index. While callosal changes seem to proceed in a posterior-to-anterior direction as the diseases progresses, this observation requires validation in future longitudinal investigations.},

Therefore, neurodegenerative disease is considered as accelerated ageing. Accurate detection of accelerated ageing based on the magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} of the brain is a relatively new direction of research in computational neuroscience as it has the potential to offer positive clinical outcome through early intervention. In order to capture the faster structural alterations in the brain with ageing, we propose in this paper a computational approach for modelling the {MRI-based} structure of the brain using the framework of hidden Markov models, which can be utilized for age prediction. Experiments were carried out on healthy subjects to validate its accuracy and its robustness. The results have shown its ability of predicting the brain age with an average normalized age-gap error of two to three years, which is superior to several recently developed methods for brain age prediction.},

The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between severe impairment of autoregulatory flow control associated with steal phenomenon and its impact on cortical thickness.
Methods 250 blood oxygen level dependent ({BOLD)} {MRI} cerebrovascular reactivity ({CVR)} studies were reviewed in order to identify subjects with severe unilateral exhausted cerebrovascular reserve demonstrating steal physiology but with normal appearing cortex on fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging. 17 patients meeting the inclusion criteria were identified. A reconstructed inflated cortical surface map was created for every subject using Freesurfer software (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). The region of interest ({ROI)} reflecting the steal physiology was determined by overlaying the subject's {CVR} map on to the cortical surface map. This {ROI} was compared with the corresponding area in the healthy hemisphere which provided control cortical thickness measurement in each subject.
Results The hemisphere with steal physiology showed an 8\% thinner cortex (2.23±0.28 mm) than the corresponding healthy hemisphere (2.42±0.23 mm) (p=0.0005).

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}

To prospectively determine if pulsed arterial spin-labeling perfusion magnetic resonance ({MR)} imaging depicts regional cerebral hypoperfusion in subjects with Alzheimer disease ({AD)} and mild cognitive impairment ({MCI)}, compared with perfusion in cognitively normal ({CN)} subjects, that is consistent with results of fluorodeoxyglucose ({FDG)} positron emission tomography ({PET)} and hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime ({HMPAO)} single photon emission computed tomography ({SPECT)} studies of similar populations.


{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}

Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained. Twenty subjects with {AD} (13 men, seven women; mean age, 72.9 years), 18 with {MCI} (nine men, nine women; mean age, 73.3 years), and 23 {CN} subjects (10 men, 13 women; mean age, 72.9 years) underwent arterial spin-labeling and volumetric T1-weighted structural {MR} imaging. Perfusion images were coregistered to structural images, corrected for partial volume effects ({PVEs)} with information from the structural image to determine tissue content of perfusion voxels, and normalized to a study-specific template. Analyses of perfusion differences between groups, with and without corrections for {PVEs}, were performed on a voxel-by-voxel basis with a one-tailed fixed-effects analysis of covariance model adjusted for age. In addition, tests were performed with and without accounting for global perfusion.


{RESULTS}

The {AD} group showed significant regional hypoperfusion, compared with the {CN} group, in the right inferior parietal cortex extending into the bilateral posterior cingulate gyri (P {\textless}.001), bilateral superior and middle frontal gyri (P {\textless}.001), and left inferior parietal lobe (P=.007). When {PVEs} from underlying cortical gray matter atrophy were accounted for, the {AD} group still showed hypoperfusion in the right inferior parietal lobe extending into the bilateral posterior cingulate gyri (P {\textless}.001) and left (P=.003) and right (P=.012) middle frontal gyri. With a more liberal voxel-level threshold of P {\textless}.01, the {MCI} group showed significant regional hypoperfusion relative to the {CN} group in the inferior right parietal lobe (P=.046), similar to the region of greatest significance in the {AD} group.


{CONCLUSION}

Arterial spin-labeling {MR} imaging showed regional hypoperfusion with {AD}, in brain regions similar to those seen in {FDG} {PET} and {HMPAO} {SPECT} studies of similar populations; this hypoperfusion persists after accounting for underlying cortical gray matter atrophy.},

	abstract = {It is often desirable to detect whether a surface has been touched, even when the changes made to that surface are too subtle to see in a pair of before and after images. To address this challenge, we introduce a new imaging technique that combines computational photography and laser speckle imaging. Without requiring controlled laboratory conditions, our method is able to detect surface changes that would be indistinguishable in regular photographs. It is also mobile and does not need to be present at the time of contact with the surface, making it well suited for applications where the surface of interest cannot be constantly monitored. Our approach takes advantage of the fact that tiny surface deformations cause phase changes in reflected coherent light which alter the speckle pattern visible under laser illumination. We take before and after images of the surface under laser light and can detect subtle contact by correlating the speckle patterns in these images. A key challenge we address is that speckle imaging is very sensitive to the location of the camera, so removing and reintroducing the camera requires high-accuracy viewpoint alignment. To this end, we use a combination of computational rephotography and correlation analysis of the speckle pattern as a function of camera translation. Our technique provides a reliable way of detecting subtle surface contact at a level that was previously only possible under laboratory conditions. With our system, the detection of these subtle surface changes can now be brought into the wild.},

Limits of agreement for difference of the measurements between different places were determined using the Bland-Altman method. In all subgroups, the {rScO2} and {cFTOE} values at different regions were not different. Limits of agreement were between ±14 and ±18\% for all subgroups. Left-to-right differences were small between different postnatal and {GAs.} A decrease and increase over time for {rScO2} and {cFTOE} values was detected for all four brain regions, most pronounced for infants with {GA} {\textless}32 wk. Cerebral oxygenation in stable preterm and term neonates seems not to differ between different regions of the brain during the early neonatal period.

	abstract = {We study the problem of detecting objects in still, gray-scale images. Our primary focus is the development of a learning-based approach to the problem that makes use of a sparse, part-based representation. A vocabulary of distinctive object parts is automatically constructed from a set of sample images of the object class of interest; images are then represented using parts from this vocabulary, together with spatial relations observed among the parts. Based on this representation, a learning algorithm is used to automatically learn to detect instances of the object class in new images. The approach can be applied to any object with distinguishable parts in a relatively fixed spatial configuration; it is evaluated here on difficult sets of real-world images containing side views of cars, and is seen to successfully detect objects in varying conditions amidst background clutter and mild occlusion. In evaluating object detection approaches, several important methodological issues arise that have not been satisfactorily addressed in previous work. A secondary focus of this paper is to highlight these issues and to develop rigorous evaluation standards for the object detection problem. A critical evaluation of our approach under the proposed standards is presented. © 2004 {IEEE.}},

Multivoxel pattern analysis ({MVPA)} represents a promising technique that is currently exploited to investigate the information contained in distributed patterns of neural activity to infer the functional role of brain areas and networks. {MVPA} is considered as a supervised classification problem where a classifier attempts to capture the relationships between spatial pattern of {fMRI} activity and experimental conditions.

	abstract = {We propose a novel framework for the automatic propagation of a set of manually labeled brain atlases to a diverse set of images of a population of subjects. A manifold is learned from a coordinate system embedding that allows the identification of neighborhoods which contain images that are similar based on a chosen criterion. Within the new coordinate system, the initial set of atlases is propagated to all images through a succession of multi-atlas segmentation steps. This breaks the problem of registering images that are very "dissimilar" down into a problem of registering a series of images that are "similar". At the same time, it allows the potentially large deformation between the images to be modeled as a sequence of several smaller deformations. We applied the proposed method to an exemplar region centered around the hippocampus from a set of 30 atlases based on images from young healthy subjects and a dataset of 796 images from elderly dementia patients and age-matched controls enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ({ADNI).} We demonstrate an increasing gain in accuracy of the new method, compared to standard multi-atlas segmentation, with increasing distance between the target image and the initial set of atlases in the coordinate embedding, i.e., with a greater difference between atlas and image. For the segmentation of the hippocampus on 182 images for which a manual segmentation is available, we achieved an average overlap (Dice coefficient) of 0.85 with the manual reference. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {We studied the local viscoelasticity of the apical membrane of human umbilical vein endothelial cells within confluent layers by magnetic tweezers microrheometry. Magnetic beads are coupled to various integrins by coating with fibronectin or invasin. By analyzing the deflection of beads evoked by various force scenarios we demonstrate that the cell envelope behaves as a linear viscoelastic body if forces up to 2 {nN} are applied for short times ({\textless}20 s) but can respond in an adaptive way if stress pulses are applied longer ({\textgreater}30 s). The time-dependent shear relaxation modulus G(t) exhibits three time regimes: a fast response (t {\textless} 0.05 s) where the relaxation modulus G(t) obeys a power law G(t) approximately t(-0.82+/-0.02); a plateau-like behavior (at 0.05 s {\textless} t {\textless} 0.15 s); and a slow flow-like response which is, however, partially reversible. Strain field mapping experiments with colloidal probes show that local forces induce a strain field exhibiting a range of zeta = 10 +/- 1 microm, but which could only be observed if nonmagnetic beads were coupled to the cell surface by invasin. By application of the theory of elasticity of planar bodies we estimated a surface shear modulus of 2.5 x10(-4) N/m. By assuming a thickness of the actin cortex of approximately 0.5 microm we estimate a Young modulus micro approximately 400 Pa for the apical membrane. The value agrees with a plateau modulus of an entangled or weakly cross-linked actin network of an actin concentration of 100 {microM} (mesh size 0.2 microm). This result together with our observation of a strong reduction of the shear modulus by the actin destabilizing agent latrunculin A suggests that the shear modulus measured by our technique is determined by the actin cortex. The effect of two ligands inducing actin stress fiber formation and centripetal contraction of cells (associated with the formation of gaps in the confluent cell monolayer) on the viscoelastic responses were studied: histamine and lysophosphatidic acid ({LPA).} Histamine evoked a dramatic increase of the cell stiffness by {\textgreater}1 order of magnitude within {\textless}30 s, which is attributed to a transient rise of the intracellular Ca(2+) level, since {DMSO} exerted a similar effect. The stiffening is accompanied by a concomitant rounding of the cells as observed by microinterferometry and relaxes partially in the timescale of 5 min, whereas gaps between cells close after approximately 30 min. {LPA} did not exert a remarkable and reproducible effect other than an occasional very weak transient increase of the shear stiffness, which shows that the gap formation activated by {LPA} is mediated by a different mechanism than that induced by histamine.},

	abstract = {Functional neuroimaging data embodies a massive multiple testing problem, where 100,000 correlated test statistics must be assessed. The familywise error rate, the chance of any false positives is the standard measure of Type I errors in multiple testing. In this paper we review and evaluate three approaches to thresholding images of test statistics: Bonferroni, random field and the permutation test. Owing to recent developments, improved Bonferroni procedures, such as Hochberg's methods, are now applicable to dependent data. Continuous random field methods use the smoothness of the image to adapt to the severity of the multiple testing problem. Also, increased computing power has made both permutation and bootstrap methods applicable to functional neuroimaging. We evaluate these approaches on t images using simulations and a collection of real datasets. We find that Bonferroni-related tests offer little improvement over Bonferroni, while the permutation method offers substantial improvement over the random field method for low smoothness and low degrees of freedom. We also show the limitations of trying to find an equivalent number of independent tests for an image of correlated test statistics.},

In this paper, we propose a framework of face recognition by adding {NMF} constraint and classifier constraints to matrix factorization to get both intuitive features and good recognition results. Based on the framework, we present two novel subspace methods: Fisher Non-negative Matrix Factorization ({FNMF)} and {PCA} Non-negative Matrix Factorization ({PNMF).} {FNMF} adds both the non-negative constraint and the Fisher constraint to matrix factorization. The Fisher constraint maximizes the between-class scatter and minimizes the within-class scatter of face samples. Subsequently, {FNMF} improves the capability of face recognition. {PNMF} adds the non-negative constraint and characteristics of {PCA}, such as maximizing the variance of output coordinates, orthogonal bases, etc. to matrix factorization. Therefore, we can get intuitive features and desirable {PCA} characteristics. Our experiments show that {FNMF} and {PNMF} achieve better face recognition performance than {NMF} and Local {NMF.} [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR]}

Changes in brain size were also assessed, showing local brain growth progressing at a rate of ∼0.4-1.5 mm per year, most prominently in frontal and occipital regions. Estimated cortical thickness ranged from 1.5 mm in occipital regions to 5.5 mm in dorsomedial frontal cortex. Gray matter thinning coupled with cortical expansion was highly significant in right frontal and bilateral parieto-occipital regions. Significant thickening was restricted to left inferior frontal (Broca's area) and bilateral posterior perisylvian (Wernicke's area on the left) regions. In the left hemisphere, gray matter thickness was correlated with changing cognitive abilities. For the first time, developmental changes in gray matter thickness, brain size, and structure-function relationships have been traced within the same individuals studied longitudinally during a time of rapid cognitive development.},

	abstract = {Nonrigid registration ({NRR)} is routinely used in the study of neuroanatomy and function and is a standard component of analysis packages such as {SPM.} There remain many unresolved correspondence problems that arise from attempts to associate functional areas with specific neuroanatomy and to compare both function and anatomy across patient groups. Problems can result from ignorance of the underlying neurology which is then compounded by unjustified inferences drawn from the results of {NRR.} Usually the magnitude, distribution, and significance of errors in {NRR} are unknown so the errors in correspondences determined by {NRR} are also unknown and their effect on experimental results cannot easily be quantified. In this paper we review the principles by which the presumed correspondence and homology of structures is used to drive registration and identify the conceptual and algorithmic areas where current techniques are lacking. We suggest that for applications using {NRR} to be robust and achieve their potential, context-specific definitions of correspondence must be developed which properly characterise error. Prior knowledge of image content must be utilised to monitor and guide registration and gauge the degree of success. The use of {NRR} in voxel-based morphometry is examined from this context and found wanting. We conclude that a move away from increasingly sophisticated but context-free registration technology is required and that the veracity of studies that rely on {NRR} should be keenly questioned when the error distribution is unknown and the results are unsupported by other contextual information.},

A technique is then presented for using these density functions to estimate global connectivity (i.e., the probability of the existence of a connection through the data field, between any two distant points), allowing for the quantification of belief in tractography results.

This finding led to the hypothesis that these regions constitute a network supporting a default mode of brain function. In this study, we investigate three questions pertaining to this hypothesis: Does such a resting-state network exist in the human brain? Is it modulated during simple sensory processing? How is it modulated during cognitive processing? To address these questions, we defined {PCC} and {vACC} regions that showed decreased activity during a cognitive (working memory) task, then examined their functional connectivity during rest. {PCC} was strongly coupled with {vACC} and several other brain regions implicated in the default mode network. Next, we examined the functional connectivity of {PCC} and {vACC} during a visual processing task and show that the resultant connectivity maps are virtually identical to those obtained during rest. Last, we defined three lateral prefrontal regions showing increased activity during the cognitive task and examined their resting-state connectivity. We report significant inverse correlations among all three lateral prefrontal regions and {PCC}, suggesting a mechanism for attenuation of default mode network activity during cognitive processing. This study constitutes, to our knowledge, the first resting-state connectivity analysis of the default mode and provides the most compelling evidence to date for the existence of a cohesive default mode network. Our findings also provide insight into how this network is modulated by task demands and what functions it might subserve.},

Although several studies have evaluated differences in basic gait parameters in people with {PD}, none have directly evaluated the stability of the upper body during gait.
{METHODS:} Temporospatial gait parameters and acceleration patterns at the head and pelvis were measured in three groups of older people: 33 controls without {PD} (mean age 67 +/- 4 years), 33 older people with {PD} and no history of falls (mean age 63 +/- 4 years), and 33 older people with {PD} and a history of falls (mean age 67 +/- 2 years). Harmonic ratios of head and pelvis accelerations in each plane were calculated to provide an indicator of upper body stability.
{RESULTS:} Compared with the control group, older people with {PD} exhibited significantly reduced walking speed and step length and increased step timing variability. Acceleration patterns were also significantly less rhythmic at the head and pelvis in all three planes. After adjusting for differences in walking speed and step timing variability, {PD} fallers exhibited significantly less rhythmic accelerations at the pelvis in the vertical and anteroposterior planes than {PD} nonfallers.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Acceleration patterns during gait differ between older people with and without {PD} and between older people with {PD} who do and do not fall. These findings suggest that an inability to control displacements of the torso when walking may predispose older people with {PD} to falls.},

Major advances have occurred in the development of disease biomarkers for {AD} in the past 2 decades. At present, the most well-developed {AD} biomarkers are the cerebrospinal fluid analytes amyloid-β 42 and tau and the brain imaging measures amyloid positron emission tomography ({PET)}, fluorodeoxyglucose {PET}, and magnetic resonance imaging. {CSF} and imaging biomarkers are incorporated into revised diagnostic guidelines for {AD}, which have recently been updated for the first time since their original formulation in 1984. Results of recent studies suggest the possibility of an ordered evolution of {AD} biomarker abnormalities that can be used to stage the typical 20-30-year course of the disease. When compared with biomarkers in other areas of medicine, however, the absence of standardized quantitative metrics for {AD} imaging biomarkers constitutes a major deficiency. Failure to move toward a standardized system of quantitative metrics has substantially limited potential diagnostic usefulness of imaging in {AD.} This presents an important opportunity that, if widely embraced, could greatly expand the application of imaging to improve clinical diagnosis and the quality and efficiency of clinical trials.},

In this paper, an Improved Principal Component Analysis ({IPCA)} is proposed for face recognition. Initially the eigenspace is created with eigenvalues and eigenvectors. From this space, the eigenfaces are constructed, and the most relevant eigenfaces have been selected using {IPCA.} With these eigenfaces, the input images are be classified based on Euclidian distance. The proposed method was tested on {ORL} face database. Experimental results on this database demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method for face recognition with less misclassification in comparison with previous methods. © 2010 {IEEE.}},

	abstract = {The complex organization of connectivity in the human brain is incompletely understood. Recently, topological measures based on graph theory have provided a new approach to quantify large-scale cortical networks. These methods have been applied to anatomical connectivity data on nonhuman species, and cortical networks have been shown to have small-world topology, associated with high local and global efficiency of information transfer. Anatomical networks derived from cortical thickness measurements have shown the same organizational properties of the healthy human brain, consistent with similar results reported in functional networks derived from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} and magnetoencephalographic data. Here we show, using anatomical networks derived from analysis of inter-regional covariation of gray matter volume in {MRI} data on 259 healthy volunteers, that classical divisions of cortex (multimodal, unimodal, and transmodal) have some distinct topological attributes. Although all cortical divisions shared nonrandom properties of small-worldness and efficient wiring (short mean Euclidean distance between connected regions), the multimodal network had a hierarchical organization, dominated by frontal hubs with low clustering, whereas the transmodal network was assortative. Moreover, in a sample of 203 people with schizophrenia, multimodal network organization was abnormal, as indicated by reduced hierarchy, the loss of frontal and the emergence of nonfrontal hubs, and increased connection distance. We propose that the topological differences between divisions of normal cortex may represent the outcome of different growth processes for multimodal and transmodal networks and that neurodevelopmental abnormalities in schizophrenia specifically impact multimodal cortical organization.},

	abstract = {Appearance and shape are two key elements exploited in medical image segmentation. However, in some medical image analysis tasks, appearance cues are weak/misleading due to disease/artifacts and often lead to erroneous segmentation. In this paper, a novel deformable model is proposed for robust segmentation in the presence of weak/misleading appearance cues. Owing to the less trustable appearance information, this method focuses on the effective shape modeling with two contributions. First, a shape composition method is designed to incorporate shape prior on-the-fly. Based on two sparsity observations, this method is robust to false appearance information and adaptive to statistically insignificant shape modes. Second, shape priors are modeled and used in a hierarchical fashion. More specifically, by using affinity propagation method, our deformable surface is divided into multiple partitions, on which local shape models are built independently. This scheme facilitates a more compact shape prior modeling and hence a more robust and efficient segmentation. Our deformable model is applied on two very diverse segmentation problems, liver segmentation in {PET-CT} images and rodent brain segmentation in {MR} images. Compared to state-of-art methods, our method achieves better performance in both studies.},

The primary goal of this study was to separate the structural decline from the true {CBF} reduction in elderly. To this end, a {PVE-correction} algorithm was applied on the {CBF} images acquired with spin-echo {EPI} continuous arterial spin labeling {MRI} (voxel size = 3.4 × 3.4 × 8 mm3). Tissue-specific {CBF} images that were independent of voxels’ tissue fractional volume were obtained in elderly (N = 30) and young (N = 26); mean age difference was 43 years. Globally, {PVE-corrected} gray matter {CBF} was 88.2 ± 16.1 and 107.3±17.5 {mL/100g} min in elderly and young, respectively. The largest {PVE} contribution was found in the frontal lobe and accounted for an additional 10\% and 12\% increase in the age-related {CBF} difference between men and women, respectively. The {GM-to-WM} {CBF} ratios were found to be on average 3.5 in elderly and 3.9 in young.

	abstract = {Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, are associated with changes in multiple neuroimaging and biological measures. These may provide complementary information for diagnosis and prognosis. We present a multi-modality classification framework in which manifolds are constructed based on pairwise similarity measures derived from random forest classifiers. Similarities from multiple modalities are combined to generate an embedding that simultaneously encodes information about all the available features. Multi-modality classification is then performed using coordinates from this joint embedding. We evaluate the proposed framework by application to neuroimaging and biological data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ({ADNI).} Features include regional {MRI} volumes, voxel-based {FDG-PET} signal intensities, {CSF} biomarker measures, and categorical genetic information. Classification based on the joint embedding constructed using information from all four modalities out-performs the classification based on any individual modality for comparisons between Alzheimer's disease patients and healthy controls, as well as between mild cognitive impairment patients and healthy controls. Based on the joint embedding, we achieve classification accuracies of 89\% between Alzheimer's disease patients and healthy controls, and 75\% between mild cognitive impairment patients and healthy controls. These results are comparable with those reported in other recent studies using multi-kernel learning. Random forests provide consistent pairwise similarity measures for multiple modalities, thus facilitating the combination of different types of feature data. We demonstrate this by application to data in which the number of features differs by several orders of magnitude between modalities. Random forest classifiers extend naturally to multi-class problems, and the framework described here could be applied to distinguish between multiple patient groups in the future.},

Our objectives were to compare the effects of subcortical ischemic vascular dementia ({SIVD)} and Alzheimer's disease ({AD)} on cerebral blood flow ({CBF)}, and then to analyze the relationship between {CBF} and subcortical vascular disease, measured as volume of white-matter lesions ({WMLs).} 
Methods 
Eight mildly demented patients with {SIVD} (mean ± {SD;} aged 77 ± 8 years; Mini-Mental State Examination score 26 ± 3 years) and 14 patients with {AD} were compared with 18 cognitively normal elderly subjects. All subjects had {CBF} measured using arterial spin-labeling magnetic resonance imaging, and brain volumes were assessed using structural magnetic resonance imaging. 
Results 
{AD} and {SIVD} showed marked {CBF} reductions in the frontal (P = 0.001) and parietal (P = 0.001) cortices. In {SIVD}, increased subcortical {WMLs} were associated with reduced {CBF} in the frontal cortex (P = 0.04), in addition to cortical atrophy (frontal, P = 0.05; parietal, P = 0.03). 
Conclusions 
Subcortical vascular disease is associated with reduced {CBF} in the cortex, irrespective of brain atrophy.},

Nanoparticulate imaging probes have included semiconductor quantum dots, magnetic and magnetofluorescent nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles and nanoshells, among others. However, the use of nanomaterials for one of the most common imaging techniques, computed tomography ({CT)}, has remained unexplored. Current {CT} contrast agents are based on small iodinated molecules. They are effective in absorbing X-rays, but non-specific distribution and rapid pharmacokinetics have rather limited their microvascular and targeting performance. Here we propose the use of a polymer-coated Bi({2)S(3)} nanoparticle preparation as an injectable {CT} imaging agent. This preparation demonstrates excellent stability at high concentrations (0.25 M Bi(3+)), high X-ray absorption (fivefold better than iodine), very long circulation times ({\textgreater}2 h) in vivo and an efficacy/safety profile comparable to or better than iodinated imaging agents. We show the utility of these polymer-coated Bi({2)S(3)} nanoparticles for enhanced in vivo imaging of the vasculature, the liver and lymph nodes in mice. These nanoparticles and their bioconjugates are expected to become an important adjunct to in vivo imaging of molecular targets and pathological conditions.},

Principal component scores were used to discriminate between {AD} patients and controls and between {MCI} converters and {MCI} non-converters. We found a significant regional pattern of atrophy (p {\textless} 0.001) in medial temporal lobes, neocortical association areas, thalamus and basal ganglia and corresponding widening of cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF)} spaces (p {\textless} 0.001) in {AD} patients compared to controls. Accuracy was 81\% for {CSF-} and 83\% for brain-based deformation maps to separate {AD} patients from controls. Nine out of 24 {MCI} patients converted to {AD} during clinical follow-up. Discrimination between {MCI} converters and non-converters reached 80\% accuracy based on {CSF} maps and 73\% accuracy based on brain maps. In a logistic regression model, principal component scores based on {CSF} maps predicted clinical outcome in {MCI} patients even after controlling for age, gender, {MMSE} score and time of follow-up.

	abstract = {Development of fine motor functions, especially drawing and handwriting, are crucial for performance in school, autonomy in everyday life and the general human development. A variety of neurological and psychiatric conditions in childhood and adolescence stunt the normal development of fine motor skills. We sought to define the normal development of the kinematic parameters of fine motor movement and determine the influence of gender, laterality of handedness and extracurricular training on fine motor skills.
One hundred and eighty-seven children and adolescents (mean age: 11.6 years ({±S.D.:} 3.58), range: 6–18 years) were included in the study. Participants performed drawing and handwriting tasks on a digitizing graphic tablet. Movement and pressure data were transferred to a computer using a sensor-equipped pen and post-processed using {CSWIN.} Movements were segmented into strokes and several kinematic parameters were calculated. The kinematic parameters that were analyzed represented speed (frequency and stroke peak velocity), automation (number of direction changes of velocity per stroke), variability (variation coefficient of stroke peak velocity) and pressure.
Progression of kinematic parameters for each movement domain of the handwriting and circle drawing tasks correlated significantly with age (Pearson's correlation, p {\textless} 0.003). Speed, automation and pressure increased with age, whereas variability decreased. Nonlinear regressions revealed maturation of hand movements at a certain age. Age of completed maturation depended on the task complexity (drawing circles vs. handwriting) and kinematic parameters. In the speed and automation domains, handwriting movements finish maturing later than circle drawing. Male subjects drew circles at significantly higher speeds than female subjects. Fine motor practice and laterality of handedness did not influence kinematic parameters. A repeated measure {ANOVA} confirmed the significant interdependency between age and complexity level for speed and automation (p {\textless} 0.001).
The digitizing graphic tablet is an extremely valuable tool in determining the normal development of hand movement skills of children and adolescents by measuring relevant daily tasks like handwriting and drawing. In our study, we showed that future analyses of impaired movement in children and adolescents need to take age and gender into consideration. Furthermore, differences were observed in the maturation of different task complexities, the complex fine motor function reaching maturity later than basic and repetitive movement patterns.},

	abstract = {Recently, several implementations of arterial spin labeling ({ASL)} techniques have been developed for producing {MRI} images sensitive to local tissue perfusion. For quantitation of perfusion, both pulsed and continuous labeling methods potentially suffer from a number of systematic errors. In this study, a general kinetic model for the {ASL} signal is described that can be used to assess these errors. With appropriate assumptions, the general model reduces to models that have been used previously to analyze {ASL} data, but the general model also provides a way to analyze the errors that result if these assumptions are not accurate. The model was used for an initial assessment of systematic errors due to the effects of variable transit delays from the tagging band to the imaging voxel, the effects of capillary/tissue exchange of water on the relaxation of the tag, and the effects of incomplete water extraction. In preliminary experiments with a human subject, the model provided a good description of pulsed {ASL} data during a simple sensorimotor activation task.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Pulsed arterial spin labeling ({PASL)} is a magnetic resonance ({MR)} method for measuring cerebral blood flow. Although several validation studies for {PASL} in animals and humans have been reported, no reports have detailed the fundamental study of {PASL} using a flow phantom. We compared the true and theoretical flow rates in a flow phantom to confirm the analytical validity of quantitative perfusion imaging with {Q2TIPS} sequence. Methods: We built a flow phantom consisting of a 40-mm diameter plastic syringe filled with plastic beads and small plastic tubes 4 mm in diameter. Gd-{DTPA-doped} {8L} water solution (0.1 {mM)} was circulated between the syringe and a tank through a plastic tube by a constant flow pump while the flow rate was adjusted between 0 and 2.61 cm/s. {Q2TIPS} sequence parameters were {TI1=50} ms and {TI2=1400} ms. Five imaging slices of 50 subtraction images were acquired sequentially in a distal-to-proximal direction using a single-shot echo planar imaging ({EPI)} technique. The theoretical flow rate calculated based upon the previously reported kinetic model for {Q2TIPS} was compared with the true flow rate. Results: A good linear relationship was observed between the theoretical, F′, and true flow rates, F, in a flow rate range of 1.43 to 1.95 cm/s ({F′=1.024•F−1.915}, R2=0.902). The ratio of theoretical to true flow rate was 92 (+/−) 4\%. Conclusion: Flow rate was quantified with reasonable accuracy when the entire amount of labeled bolus within the phantom could be recovered. Our experiment confirmed the analytical validity of {Q2TIPS} and suggested that blood flow measurement may be feasible using the {Q2TIPS} pulse sequence and kinetic model of the {PASL} equation.},

We cast the segmentation problem as the maximization of the mutual information between the region labels and the image pixel intensities, subject to a constraint on the total length of the region boundaries. We assume that the probability densities associated with the image pixel intensities within each region are completely unknown a priori, and we formulate the problem based on nonparametric density estimates. Due to the nonparametric structure, our method does not require the image regions to have a particular type of probability distribution and does not require the extraction and use of a particular statistic. We solve the information-theoretic optimization problem by deriving the associated gradient flows and applying curve evolution techniques. We use level-set methods to implement the resulting evolution. The experimental results based on both synthetic and real images demonstrate that the proposed technique can solve a variety of challenging image segmentation problems. Futhermore, our method, which does not require any training, performs as good as methods based on training.},

However, the relationship of {FA} to other structural indices of cerebral health has not been well studied. We hypothesized that the decline in {WM} health will be associated with changes in several other indices of cerebral health. In this manuscript we studied the correlation between whole-brain/hemispheric/corpus callosum {FA} and gray matter ({GM)} thickness, sulcal span, and the volume of T2-hyperintense {WM} in a group of 31 healthy aging individuals (12 males/19 females) aged 57–82 years old. Individual subjects' {FA} measures were calculated from diffusion tracing imaging ({DTI)} data using tract-based spatial statistics—an approach specifically designed and validated for voxel-wise multi-subject {FA} analysis. Age-controlled correlation analysis showed that whole-brain average {FA} values were significantly and positively correlated with the subject's average {GM} thickness and negatively correlated with hyperintense {WM} volume. Intra-hemispheric correlations between {FA} and other measures of cerebral health had generally greater effect sizes than inter-hemispheric correction, with correlation between left {FA} and left {GM} thickness being the most significant (r\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;0.6, p\&\#xa0;\&lt;\&\#xa0;0.01). Regional analysis of {FA} values showed that late-myelinating fiber tracts of the genu of corpus callosum had higher association with other cerebral health indices. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that late-myelinating regions of the brain bear the brunt of age-related degenerative changes.},

At the internal capsules, {FA} was higher on the right. {MD} showed an upward trend, progressing caudally from the internal capsules to the pyramids. {MD} was higher at the level of the internal capsule in the {ALS} group, but caudally this difference was not maintained. No correlations were found between clinical markers of disability and water diffusion indices. , Conclusions: These findings provide insights into the pathological processes of {ALS.} Differences in diffusion characteristics at different anatomical levels may relate to underlying tract architecture or the distribution of pathological damage in {ALS.} Further development may permit monitoring of progression and treatment of disease.},

Our goal was to improve spatiotemporal interpretability as well as classification accuracy. To this end, sparse penalized discriminant analysis ({SPDA)} enabled automatic selection of correlated variables, yielding interpretable models that generalized well to new data. Relative to logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, and linear support vector machines, {SPDA} not only increased interpretability but also improved classification accuracy. {SPDA} promises to allow more precise inferences about when specific brain regions contribute to purchasing decisions.

As in other biomedical imaging areas such as radiology, many computer assisted diagnosis ({CAD)} systems have been implemented to aid histopathologists and clinicians in cancer diagnosis and research, which have been attempted to significantly reduce the labor and subjectivity of traditional manual intervention with histology images. The task of automated histology image analysis is usually not simple due to the unique characteristics of histology imaging, including the variability in image preparation techniques, clinical interpretation protocols, and the complex structures and very large size of the images themselves. In this paper we discuss those characteristics, provide relevant background information about slide preparation and interpretation, and review the application of digital image processing techniques to the field of histology image analysis. In particular, emphasis is given to state-of-the-art image segmentation methods for feature extraction and disease classification. Four major carcinomas of cervix, prostate, breast, and lung are selected to illustrate the functions and capabilities of existing {CAD} systems.},

We propose a new procedure, called Lassoed Principal Components ({LPC)}, that builds upon existing methods and can provide a sizable improvement. For instance, in the case of two-class data, a standard (albeit simple) approach might be to compute a two-sample t-statistic for each gene. The {LPC} method involves projecting these conventional gene scores onto the eigenvectors of the gene expression data covariance matrix and then applying an L₁ penalty in order to de-noise the resulting projections.

	abstract = {Recently there has been a lot of interest in geometrically motivated approaches to data analysis in high dimensional spaces. We consider the case where data is drawn from sampling a probability distribution that has support on or near a submanifold of Euclidean space. In this paper, we propose a novel subspace learning algorithm called Neighborhood Preserving Embedding ({NPE).} Different from Principal Component Analysis ({PCA)} which aims at preserving the global Euclidean structure, {NPE} aims at preserving the local neighborhood structure on the data manifold. Therefore, {NPE} is less sensitive to outliers than {PCA.} Also, comparing to the recently proposed manifold learning algorithms such as Isomap and Locally Linear Embedding, {NPE} is defined everywhere, rather than only on the training data points. Furthermore, {NPE} may be conducted in the original space or in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space into which data points are mapped. This gives rise to kernel {NPE.} Several experiments on face database demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm. © 2005 {IEEE.}},

This study aimed to explore the cerebral structural alterations of subjects with {MCI} or {AD} as compared to healthy elderly based on the individual and collective effects of cerebral morphologic indices using univariate and multivariate analyses.
T1-weighted images ({T1WIs)} were retrieved from Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database for 116 subjects who were categorized into groups of healthy aging, {MCI}, and {AD.} Analysis of covariance ({ANCOVA)} and multivariate analysis of covariance ({MANCOVA)} were performed to explore the intergroup morphologic alterations indexed by surface area, curvature index, cortical thickness, and subjacent white matter volume with age and sex controlled as covariates, in 34 parcellated gyri regions of interest ({ROIs)} for both cerebral hemispheres based on the {T1WI.} Statistical parameters were mapped on the anatomic images to facilitate visual inspection.
Global rather than region-specific structural alterations were revealed in groups of {MCI} and {AD} relative to healthy elderly using {MANCOVA.} {ANCOVA} revealed that the cortical thickness decreased more prominently in entorhinal, temporal, and cingulate cortices and was positively correlated with patients' cognitive performance in {AD} group but not in {MCI.} The temporal lobe features marked atrophy of white matter during the disease dynamics. Significant intercorrelations were observed among the morphologic indices with univariate analysis for given {ROIs.}
Significant global structural alterations were identified in {MCI} and {AD} based on {MANCOVA} model with improved sensitivity. The intercorrelation among the morphologic indices may dampen the use of individual morphological parameter in featuring cerebral structural alterations. Decrease in cortical thickness is not reflective of the cognitive performance at the early stage of {AD.}},

To assess structural brain maturation from childhood to adulthood, we charted brain development in subjects aged 5 to 30 years using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging, a novel brain imaging technique that is sensitive to axonal packing and myelination and is particularly adept at virtually extracting white matter connections. Age-related changes were seen in major white matter tracts, deep gray matter, and subcortical white matter, in our large (n = 202), age-distributed sample. These diffusion changes followed an exponential pattern of maturation with considerable regional variation. Differences observed in developmental timing suggest a pattern of maturation in which areas with fronto-temporal connections develop more slowly than other regions. These in vivo results expand upon previous postmortem and imaging studies and provide quantitative measures indicative of the progression and magnitude of regional human brain maturation. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, accurate {PV} correction ({PVC)} procedures are required. {PVC} is commonly based on {PV} maps obtained from segmented high-resolution T1-weighted images. Segmentation of these images is error-prone, and it can be difficult to coregister these images accurately with the single-shot {ASL} images such as those created by echo-planar imaging ({EPI).} In this paper, an alternative method for {PV} map generation is proposed. Methods: The Look-Locker {EPI} ({LL-EPI)} acquisition is used for analyzing the T1-recovery curve and for subsequent {PV} map generation. The new method was evaluated in five healthy volunteers (mean age 30 ± 3.7 years). Results: By applying a linear regression method for {PVC}, a 12\% decrease in regression error was reached with the new method. Conclusion: {PV} maps extraction from {LL-EPI} is a viable, possibly superior alternative to the standard approach based on segmentation of high-resolution T1-weighted images.

Atherosclerosis, diabetes, heart failure, and ischemia with attendant reperfusion injury share many of the same risk factors, among the most important being oxidative stress and alterations in the blood concentrations of compounds that influence oxidative stress, such as oxidized low-density lipoprotein. In this review, we focus on endothelial cells: cells in the frontline against these disturbances. Because {ATP} supplies in endothelial cells are relatively independent of mitochondrial oxidative pathways, the mitochondria of endothelial cells have been somewhat neglected. However, they are emerging as agents with diverse roles in modulating the dynamics of intracellular calcium and the generation of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide. The mitochondria may also constitute critical "targets" of oxidative stress, because survival of endothelial cells can be compromised by opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore or by mitochondrial pathways of apoptosis. In addition, evidence suggests that endothelial mitochondria may play a "reconnaissance" role. For example, although the exact mechanism remains obscure, endothelial mitochondria may sense levels of oxygen in the blood and relay this information to cardiac myocytes as well as modulating the vasodilatory response mediated by endothelial nitric oxide.},

Several independent studies have demonstrated that small amounts of in-scanner motion systematically bias estimates of resting-state functional connectivity. This confound is of particular importance for studies of neurodevelopment in youth because motion is strongly related to subject age during this period. Critically, the effects of motion on connectivity mimic major findings in neurodevelopmental research, specifically an age-related strengthening of distant connections and weakening of short-range connections. Here, in a sample of 780 subjects ages 8–22, we re-evaluate patterns of change in functional connectivity during adolescent development after rigorously controlling for the confounding influences of motion at both the subject and group levels. We find that motion artifact inflates both overall estimates of age-related change as well as specific distance-related changes in connectivity. When motion is more fully accounted for, the prevalence of age-related change as well as the strength of distance-related effects is substantially reduced. However, age-related changes remain highly significant. In contrast, motion artifact tends to obscure age-related changes in connectivity associated with segregation of functional brain modules; improved preprocessing techniques allow greater sensitivity to detect increased within-module connectivity occurring with development. Finally, we show that subject’s age can still be accurately estimated from the multivariate pattern of functional connectivity even while controlling for motion. Taken together, these results indicate that while motion artifact has a marked and heterogeneous impact on estimates of connectivity change during adolescence, functional connectivity remains a valuable phenotype for the study of neurodevelopment.},

Here, we present the development of voxel-based connectivity measures along the tractography-derived corticospinal tract ({CST).} We investigated whether these connectivity measures are different in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ({ALS)} and correlate with the rate of disease progression. We also investigated whether fractional anisotropy ({FA)}, which reflects directional coherence of fibre tracts, is reduced in the {CST} of {ALS} patients and relates to disease progression rate. Thirteen patients with probable or definite {ALS} and 19 healthy subjects were studied. The probabilistic tractography algorithm segmented the bilateral {CST}, along which {FA} and connectivity values were obtained. To take into account the asymmetric distribution of connectivity values, two summary statistic measures that focused on voxels with higher connectivity values were selected and then used in the analysis, together with the mean connectivity and the mean {FA.} To complete the analysis, the same summary measures for {FA} were included. Differences in all these indices between patients with moderate or rapid disease progression rate and controls were investigated using linear regression, adjusted for age and white matter fraction. The association between {FA} or connectivity in the {CST} and the disease progression rate was assessed using linear regression. Patients with a rapid disease progression rate had significantly lower summary connectivity measures than controls in the left {CST}, but there was only a borderline statistical difference in mean connectivity. Patients with rapid progression had a significantly lower mean {FA}, and any other {FA} measure, in both {CSTs} than controls. When only patients were considered, strong associations between the rate of disease progression and all the connectivity measures in the left {CST} were found (P-values between P {\textless} 0.001 and P = 0.002, partial correlation coefficients between −0.90 and −0.82). However, there was no evidence of an association between disease progression rate and any of the {FA} measures in the bilateral {CST.} Our findings suggest that {FA} and connectivity provide complementary information, since {FA} is sensitive to the detection of all the group differences, whereas the summary connectivity measures correlate with disease progression rate. The development of such connectivity measures raises their potential as markers of disease progression in {ALS}, and provides guidance for their use in other neurological diseases.},

An abundance of high-dimensional data has meant that L 1 penalized regression, known as the lasso, has become an indispensable tool of the practitioner. A feature of the lasso is a “tuning” parameter that controls the amount of shrinkage applied to the coefficients. In practice, a value for the tuning parameter is chosen using the method of cross-validation. It is shown that the model that is selected by the lasso can be extremely sensitive to the fold assignment used for cross-validation. A consequence of this sensitivity is that the results from a lasso analysis can lack interpretability. To overcome this model-selection instability of the lasso, a method called the percentile-lasso is introduced. The model selected by the percentile-lasso corresponds to the model selected by the lasso, when the lasso is fitted using an appropriate percentile of the possible “optimal” tuning parameter values. It is demonstrated that the percentile-lasso can achieve substantial improvements in both model-selection stability and model-selection error compared to the lasso. Importantly, when applied to real data the percentile-lasso, unlike the lasso, produces interpretable results, that is, results that are robust to the assignment of observations to folds for cross-validation. The percentile-lasso is easily applied to extensions of the lasso and in the context of penalized generalized linear models.},

	abstract = {Understanding the organization of the cerebral cortex remains a central focus of neuroscience. Cortical maps have relied almost exclusively on the examination of postmortem tissue to construct structural, architectonic maps. These maps have invariably distinguished between areas with fewer discernable layers, which have a less complex overall pattern of lamination and lack an internal granular layer, and those with more complex laminar architecture. The former includes several agranular limbic areas, and the latter includes the homotypical and granular areas of association and sensory cortex. Here, we relate these traditional maps to developmental data from noninvasive neuroimaging. Changes in cortical thickness were determined in vivo from 764 neuroanatomic magnetic resonance images acquired longitudinally from 375 typically developing children and young adults. We find differing levels of complexity of cortical growth across the cerebrum, which align closely with established architectonic maps. Cortical regions with simple laminar architecture, including most limbic areas, predominantly show simpler growth trajectories. These areas have clearly identified homologues in all mammalian brains and thus likely evolved in early mammals. In contrast, polysensory and high-order association areas of cortex, the most complex areas in terms of their laminar architecture, also have the most complex developmental trajectories. Some of these areas are unique to, or dramatically expanded in primates, lending an evolutionary significance to the findings. Furthermore, by mapping a key characteristic of these development trajectories (the age of attaining peak cortical thickness) we document the dynamic, heterochronous maturation of the cerebral cortex through time lapse sequences (“movies”).},

	doi = {10.1016/j.media.2012.10.004},
	abstract = {Even though 1 in 6 men in the {US}, in their lifetime are expected to be diagnosed with prostate cancer ({CaP)}, only 1 in 37 is expected to die on account of it. Consequently, among many men diagnosed with {CaP}, there has been a recent trend to resort to active surveillance (wait and watch) if diagnosed with a lower Gleason score on biopsy, as opposed to seeking immediate treatment. Some researchers have recently identified imaging markers for low and high grade {CaP} on multi-parametric ({MP)} magnetic resonance ({MR)} imaging (such as T2 weighted {MR} imaging (T2w {MRI)} and {MR} spectroscopy ({MRS)).} In this paper, we present a novel computerized decision support system ({DSS)}, called Semi Supervised Multi Kernel Graph Embedding ({SeSMiK-GE)}, that quantitatively combines structural, and metabolic imaging data for distinguishing (a) benign versus cancerous, and (b) high- versus low-Gleason grade {CaP} regions from in vivo {MP-MRI.} A total of 29 {1.5Tesla} endorectal pre-operative in vivo {MP} {MRI} (T2w {MRI}, {MRS)} studies from patients undergoing radical prostatectomy were considered in this study. Ground truth for evaluation of the {SeSMiK-GE} classifier was obtained via annotation of disease extent on the pre-operative imaging by visually correlating the {MRI} to the ex vivo whole mount histologic specimens. The {SeSMiK-GE} framework comprises of three main modules: (1) multi-kernel learning, (2) semi-supervised learning, and (3) dimensionality reduction, which are leveraged for the construction of an integrated low dimensional representation of the different imaging and non-imaging {MRI} protocols. Hierarchical classifiers for diagnosis and Gleason grading of {CaP} are then constructed within this unified low dimensional representation. Step 1 of the hierarchical classifier employs a random forest classifier in conjunction with the {SeSMiK-GE} based data representation and a probabilistic pairwise Markov Random Field algorithm (which allows for imposition of local spatial constraints) to yield a voxel based classification of {CaP} presence. The {CaP} region of interest identified in Step 1 is then subsequently classified as either high or low Gleason grade {CaP} in Step 2. Comparing {SeSMiK-GE} with unimodal T2w {MRI}, {MRS} classifiers and a commonly used feature concatenation ({COD)} strategy, yielded areas ({AUC)} under the receiver operative curve ({ROC)} of (a) 0.89±0.09 ({SeSMiK)}, 0.54±0.18 (T2w {MRI)}, 0.61±0.20 ({MRS)}, and 0.64±0.23 ({COD)} for distinguishing benign from {CaP} regions, and (b) 0.84±0.07 ({SeSMiK)},0.54±0.13 ({MRI)}, 0.59±0.19 ({MRS)}, and 0.62±0.18 ({COD)} for distinguishing high and low grade {CaP} using a leave one out cross-validation strategy, all evaluations being performed on a per voxel basis. Our results suggest that following further rigorous validation, {SeSMiK-GE} could be developed into a powerful diagnostic and prognostic tool for detection and grading of {CaP} in vivo and in helping to determine the appropriate treatment option. Identifying low grade disease in vivo might allow {CaP} patients to opt for active surveillance rather than immediately opt for aggressive therapy such as radical prostatectomy.},

	abstract = {While a pathway for Ca2+ accumulation into mitochondria has long been established, its functional significance is only now becoming clear in relation to cell physiology and pathophysiology. The observation that mitochondria take up Ca2+ during physiological Ca2+ signalling in a variety of cell types leads to four questions: (i) {'What} is the impact of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake on mitochondrial function?' (ii) {'What} is the impact of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake on Ca2+ signalling?' (iii) {'What} are the consequences of impaired mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake for cell function?' and finally (iv) {'What} are the consequences of pathological [Ca2+]c signalling for mitochondrial function?' These will be addressed in turn. Thus: (i) accumulation of Ca2+ into mitochondria regulates mitochondrial metabolism and causes a transient depolarisation of mitochondrial membrane potential. (ii) Mitochondria may act as a spatial Ca2+ buffer in many cells, regulating the local Ca2+ concentration in cellular microdomains. This process regulates processes dependent on local cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c), particularly the flux of Ca2+ through {IP3-gated} channels of the endoplasmic reticulum ({ER)} and the channels mediating capacitative Ca2+ influx through the plasma membrane. Consequently, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake plays a substantial role in shaping [Ca2+]c signals in many cell types. (iii) Impaired mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake alters the spatiotemporal characteristics of cellular [Ca2+]c signalling and downregulates mitochondrial metabolism. (iv) Under pathological conditions of cellular [Ca2+]c overload, particularly in association with oxidative stress, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake may trigger pathological states that lead to cell death. In the model of glutamate excitotoxicity, microdomains of [Ca2+]c are apparently central, as the pathway to cell death seems to require the local activation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase ({nNOS)}, itself held by scaffolding proteins in close association with the {NMDA} receptor. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in combination with {NO} production triggers the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, culminating in delayed cell death.},

	abstract = {This paper presents feature-based morphometry ({FBM)}, a new fully data-driven technique for discovering patterns of group-related anatomical structure in volumetric imagery. In contrast to most morphometry methods which assume one-to-one correspondence between subjects, {FBM} explicitly aims to identify distinctive anatomical patterns that may only be present in subsets of subjects, due to disease or anatomical variability. The image is modeled as a collage of generic, localized image features that need not be present in all subjects. Scale-space theory is applied to analyze image features at the characteristic scale of underlying anatomical structures, instead of at arbitrary scales such as global or voxel-level. A probabilistic model describes features in terms of their appearance, geometry, and relationship to subject groups, and is automatically learned from a set of subject images and group labels. Features resulting from learning correspond to group-related anatomical structures that can potentially be used as image biomarkers of disease or as a basis for computer-aided diagnosis. The relationship between features and groups is quantified by the likelihood of feature occurrence within a specific group vs. the rest of the population, and feature significance is quantified in terms of the false discovery rate. Experiments validate {FBM} clinically in the analysis of normal ({NC)} and Alzheimer's ({AD)} brain images using the freely available {OASIS} database. {FBM} automatically identifies known structural differences between {NC} and {AD} subjects in a fully data-driven fashion, and an equal error classification rate of 0.80 is achieved for subjects aged 60–80 years exhibiting mild {AD} ({CDR} = 1).},

The form of this penalty encourages sparse solutions (with many coefficients equal to 0). We propose the ‘fused lasso’, a generalization that is designed for problems with features that can be ordered in some meaningful way. The fused lasso penalizes the L1-norm of both the coefficients and their successive differences. Thus it encourages sparsity of the coefficients and also sparsity of their differences—i.e. local constancy of the coefficient profile. The fused lasso is especially useful when the number of features p is much greater than N, the sample size. The technique is also extended to the ‘hinge’ loss function that underlies the support vector classifier. We illustrate the methods on examples from protein mass spectroscopy and gene expression data.},

	abstract = {This study reports the first comprehensive three-dimensional ({3D)} maps of cortical patterns in children. Using a novel parametric mesh-based analytic technique applied to high-resolution T1-weighted {MRI} scans, we examined age (6–16 years) and gender differences in cortical complexity (the fractal dimension or complexity of sulcal/gyral convolutions) and asymmetry of 24 primary cortical sulci in normally developing children (N=24). Three-dimensional models of the cerebral cortex were extracted and major sulci mapped in stereotaxic space. Given the documented age-related changes in frontal lobe functions and several neuroimaging studies that have reported accompanying volumetric changes in these regions, we hypothesized that, with age, we would find continued modifications of the cerebrum in frontal cortex. We also predicted that phylogenetically older regions of the cerebrum, such as olfactory cortex, would be less variable in anatomic location across subjects and with age. Age-related increases in cortical complexity were found in both left and right inferior frontal and left superior frontal regions, possibly indicating an increase in secondary branching with age in these regions. Moreover, a significant increase in the length of the left inferior frontal sulcus and a posterior shifting of the left pre-central sulcus was associated with age. Three-dimensional asymmetry and anatomic variability maps revealed a significant left-greater-than-right asymmetry of the Sylvian fissures and superior temporal sulci, and increased variance in dorsolateral frontal and perisylvian areas relative to ventral regions of the cortex. These results suggest increases in cortical complexity and subtle modifications of sulcal topography of frontal lobe regions, likely reflecting ongoing processes such as myelination and synaptic remodeling that continue into the second decade of life. More studies in a larger sample set and/or longitudinal design are needed to address the issues of normal individual variation and sulcal development.},

Preliminary data from able-bodied ambulators were collected and analyzed using the model., Summary of Background Data. Neither the spine's role during walking nor the effect of surgical spinal stabilization on gait is fully understood. Typically, gait analysis models disregard the spine entirely or regard it as a single rigid structure. Data on regional spinal movements, in conjunction with lower limb data, associated with walking are scarce., Methods. {KinTrak} software (Motion Analysis Corp., Santa Rosa, {CA)} was used to create a biomechanical model for analysis of 3-dimensional regional spinal movements. Measuring known angles from a mechanical model and comparing them to the calculated angles validated the kinematic model. Spine motion data were collected from 10 able-bodied adults walking at 5 self-selected speeds. These results were compared to data reported in the literature., Results. The uniaxial angles measured on the mechanical model were within 5[degrees] of the calculated kinematic model angles, and the coupled angles were within 2[degrees]. Regional spine kinematics from able-bodied subjects calculated with this model compared well to data reported by other authors., Conclusions. A multi-segment kinematic spine model has been developed and validated for analysis of spinal motion during walking. By understanding the spine's role during ambulation and the cause-and-effect relationship between spine motion and lower limb motion, preoperative planning may be augmented to restore normal alignment and balance with minimal negative effects on walking., (C) 2006 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins, Inc.},

However, in high dimensional data analysis, when the number of variables under consideration exceeds tens of thousands, linear combinations of the entire sets of features may lack biological plausibility and interpretability. In addition, insufficient sample size may lead to computational problems, inaccurate estimates of parameters and non-generalizable results. These problems may be solved by selecting sparse subsets of variables, i.e. obtaining sparse loadings in the linear combinations of variables of each type. In this paper we present Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis ({SCCA)} which examines the relationships between two types of variables and provides sparse solutions that include only small subsets of variables of each type by maximizing the correlation between the subsets of variables of different types while performing variable selection. We also present an extension of {SCCA--adaptive} {SCCA.} We evaluate their properties using simulated data and illustrate practical use by applying both methods to the study of natural variation in human gene expression.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel method, called local non-negative matrix factorization ({LNMF)}, for learning spatially localized, parts-based subspace representation of visual patterns. An objective function is defined to impose localization constraint, in addition to the non-negativity constraint in the standard {NMF.} This gives a set of bases which not only allows a non-subtractive (part-based) representation of images but also manifests localized features. An algorithm is presented for the learning of such basis components. Experimental results are presented to compare {LNMF} with the {NMF} and {PCA} methods for face representation and recognition, which demonstrates advantages of {LNMF.}},

	abstract = {The looming potential of deformable alignment tools to play an integral role in adaptive radiotherapy suggests a need for objective assessment of these complex algorithms. Previous studies in this area are based on the ability of alignment to reproduce analytically generated deformations applied to sample image data, or use of contours or bifurcations as ground truth for evaluation of alignment accuracy. In this study, a deformable phantom was embedded with 48 small plastic markers, placed in regions varying from high contrast to roughly uniform regional intensity, and small to large regional discontinuities in movement. {CT} volumes of this phantom were acquired at different deformation states. After manual localization of marker coordinates, images were edited to remove the markers. The resulting image volumes were sent to five collaborating institutions, each of which has developed previously published deformable alignment tools routinely in use. Alignments were done, and applied to the list of reference coordinates at the inhale state. The transformed coordinates were compared to the actual marker locations at exhale. A total of eight alignment techniques were tested from the six institutions. All algorithms performed generally well, as compared to previous publications. Average errors in predicted location ranged from 1.5 to 3.9 mm, depending on technique. No algorithm was uniformly accurate across all regions of the phantom, with maximum errors ranging from 5.1 to 15.4 mm. Larger errors were seen in regions near significant shape changes, as well as areas with uniform contrast but large local motion discontinuity. Although reasonable accuracy was achieved overall, the variation of error in different regions suggests caution in globally accepting the results from deformable alignment.},

	abstract = {Interest is increasing in applying discriminative multivariate analysis techniques to the analysis of functional neuroimaging data. Model interpretation is of great importance in the neuroimaging context, and is conventionally based on a ‘brain map’ derived from the classification model. In this study we focus on the relative influence of model regularization parameter choices on both the model generalization, the reliability of the spatial patterns extracted from the classification model, and the ability of the resulting model to identify relevant brain networks defining the underlying neural encoding of the experiment. For a support vector machine, logistic regression and Fisher's discriminant analysis we demonstrate that selection of model regularization parameters has a strong but consistent impact on the generalizability and both the reproducibility and interpretable sparsity of the models for both ℓ 2 and ℓ 1 regularization. Importantly, we illustrate a trade-off between model spatial reproducibility and prediction accuracy. We show that known parts of brain networks can be overlooked in pursuing maximization of classification accuracy alone with either ℓ 2 and/or ℓ 1 regularization. This supports the view that the quality of spatial patterns extracted from models cannot be assessed purely by focusing on prediction accuracy. Our results instead suggest that model regularization parameters must be carefully selected, so that the model and its visualization enhance our ability to interpret the brain.},

	abstract = {When humans are accelerated along the body vertical, the right and left eyes show oppositely directed torsional modulation (cyclovergence). The origin of this paradoxical response is unknown. We studied cyclovergence during linear sinusoidal vertical motion in healthy humans. A small head-fixed visual target minimized horizontal and vertical motion of the eyes and therefore isolated the torsional component. For stimuli between 1 and 2 Hz (near the natural range of head motion), the phase of cyclovergence with respect to inertial acceleration was 8.7 ± 2.4° (mean ± 95\% {CI)} and the sensitivity (in degrees per second per g) showed a small but statistically significant increase with frequency. These characteristics contrast with those of cycloversion (conjugate torsion) during horizontal (interaural) inertial stimuli at similar frequencies. From these and previous results, we propose that cyclovergence during vertical translation has two sources, one, like cycloversion, from the low-frequency component of linear acceleration, and another, which we term dynamic cyclovergence, with high-pass characteristics. Furthermore, we suggest that this cyclovergence response in humans is a vestige of the response of lateral-eyed animals to vertical linear acceleration of the head.},

This architecture is genetically heritable, is associated with behavioural and cognitive abilities and is changed systematically across the lifespan.

The alternative to these pattern analysis methods, namely mass univariate methods such as voxel based analysis and all related methods, cannot detect multivariate patterns associated with group differences, and are not particularly suitable for developing individual-based diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. A commonly used pattern analysis tool is the support vector machine ({SVM).} Unlike univariate statistical frameworks for morphometry, analytical tools for statistical inference are unavailable for the {SVM.} In this paper, we show that null distributions ordinarily obtained by permutation tests using {SVMs} can be analytically approximated from the data. The analytical computation takes a small fraction of the time it takes to do an actual permutation test, thereby rendering it possible to quickly create statistical significance maps derived from {SVMs.} Such maps are critical for understanding imaging patterns of group differences and interpreting which anatomical regions are important in determining the classifier’s decision.},

Materials and Methods: The local institutional review board approved the study. All subjects provided informed consent. Whole-brain {3D} fast spin-echo pseudocontinuous {ASL} images were acquired at 3.0 T in 71 patients with {AD} (mean age, 65 years ± 7; 55\% women), 35 patients with {MCI} (mean age, 65 years ± 8; 42\% women), and 73 subjects with subjective complaints (mean age, 60 years ± 9; 39\% women) who visited a memory clinic. Analyses were performed by using both uncorrected maps and maps corrected for partial volume effects. Regional {CBF} was compared by using analyses of variance; permutation tests were used for voxel-wise comparisons. Associations with cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination) were investigated by using linear regression analyses. All analyses were corrected for age and sex.
Results: Uncorrected {CBF} was decreased in patients with {AD} compared with subjects with subjective complaints (27 {mL/100} g/min ± 5 vs 33 {mL/100} g/min ± 5; P {\textless} .001), with strongest reductions in the parietal lobes (22 {mL/100} g/min ± 6 vs 30 {mL/100} g/min ± 5; ie, decrease of 27\%). Corrected cortical {CBF} showed similar results. In patients with {MCI}, {CBF} was decreased in the precuneus and the parietal and occipital lobes compared with subjects with subjective complaints. Voxel-wise comparisons confirmed the region of interest–based findings, showing the largest {CBF} differences in the precuneus and bilateral parietal cortex. Uncorrected and corrected cortical {CBF} were associated with cognition across diagnostic groups (β = 0.46 and β = 0.42, P {\textless} .001) and within the {AD} group (β = 0.41 and β = 0.42, P {\textless} .001).
Conclusion: {CBF} measured with {3D} pseudocontinuous {ASL} {MR} imaging helps detect functional changes in the prodromal and more advanced stages of {AD} and is a marker for disease severity. © {RSNA}, 2012},

Within each neighborhood, we determine the optimal regression coefficients that relate local patterns to the continuous variable of interest. As each voxel belongs to multiple overlapping neighborhoods, the statistic for a given voxel is determined by combining weights from all neighborhoods to which the voxel participates. Finally, non-parametric permutation testing is used to obtain a voxelwise significance map. Using both simulated and real {fMRI} data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {An enhanced understanding of how normal aging alters brain structure is urgently needed for the early diagnosis and treatment of age-related mental diseases. Structural magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} is a reliable technique used to detect age-related changes in the human brain. Currently, multivariate pattern analysis ({MVPA)} enables the exploration of subtle and distributed changes of data obtained from structural {MRI} images. In this study, a new {MVPA} approach based on sparse representation has been employed to investigate the anatomical covariance patterns of normal aging. Two groups of participants (group 1:290 participants; group 2:56 participants) were evaluated in this study. These two groups were scanned with two 1.5 T {MRI} machines. In the first group, we obtained the discriminative patterns using a t-test filter and sparse representation step. We were able to distinguish the young from old cohort with a very high accuracy using only a few voxels of the discriminative patterns (group 1:98.4\%; group 2:96.4\%). The experimental results showed that the selected voxels may be categorized into two components according to the two steps in the proposed method. The first component focuses on the precentral and postcentral gyri, and the caudate nucleus, which play an important role in sensorimotor tasks. The strongest volume reduction with age was observed in these clusters. The second component is mainly distributed over the cerebellum, thalamus, and right inferior frontal gyrus. These regions are not only critical nodes of the sensorimotor circuitry but also the cognitive circuitry although their volume shows a relative resilience against aging. Considering the voxels selection procedure, we suggest that the aging of the sensorimotor and cognitive brain regions identified in this study has a covarying relationship with each other. © 2012 Su et al.},

However, the seizures are not confined to the temporal lobe but can spread to other, anatomically connected brain regions where they can cause similar structural abnormalities as observed in the focus. The aim of this study was to derive whole-brain networks from volumetric data and obtain network-centric measures, which can capture cortical thinning characteristic of {TLE} and can be used for classifying a given {MRI} into {TLE} or normal, and to obtain additional summary statistics that relate to the extent and spread of the disease. T1-weighted whole-brain images were acquired on a 4-T magnet in 13 patients with {TLE} with mesial temporal lobe sclerosis ({TLE–MTS)}, 14 patients with {TLE} with normal {MRI} ({TLE-no)}, and 30 controls. Mean cortical thickness and curvature measurements were obtained using the {FreeSurfer} software. These values were used to derive a graph, or network, for each subject. The nodes of the graph are brain regions, and edges represent disease progression paths. We show how to obtain summary statistics like mean, median, and variance defined for these networks and to perform exploratory analyses like correlation and classification. Our results indicate that the proposed network approach can improve accuracy of classifying subjects into two groups (control and {TLE)} from 78\% for non-network classifiers to 93\% using the proposed approach. We also obtain network “peakiness” values using statistical measures like entropy and complexity—this appears to be a good characterizer of the disease and may have utility in surgical planning.},

	abstract = {Leveraging available annotated data is an essential component of many modern methods for medical image analysis. In particular, approaches making use of the “neighbourhood” structure between images for this purpose have shown significant potential. Such techniques achieve high accuracy in analysing an image by propagating information from its immediate “neighbours” within an annotated database. Despite their success in certain applications, wide use of these methods is limited due to the challenging task of determining the neighbours for an out-of-sample image. This task is either computationally expensive due to large database sizes and costly distance evaluations, or infeasible due to distance definitions over semantic information, such as ground truth annotations, which is not available for out-of-sample images.
This article introduces Neighbourhood Approximation Forests ({NAFs)}, a supervised learning algorithm providing a general and efficient approach for the task of approximate nearest neighbour retrieval for arbitrary distances. Starting from an image training database and a user-defined distance between images, the algorithm learns to use appearance-based features to cluster images approximating the neighbourhood structured induced by the distance. {NAF} is able to efficiently infer nearest neighbours of an out-of-sample image, even when the original distance is based on semantic information. We perform experimental evaluation in two different scenarios: (i) age prediction from brain {MRI} and (ii) patch-based segmentation of unregistered, arbitrary field of view {CT} images. The results demonstrate the performance, computational benefits, and potential of {NAF} for different image analysis applications.},

	abstract = {The authors have devised, implemented, and tested a fast, spatially accurate technique for calculating the high-dimensional deformation field relating the brain anatomies of an arbitrary pair of subjects. The resulting three-dimensional (3-D) deformation map can be used to quantify anatomic differences between subjects or within the same subject over time and to transfer functional information between subjects or integrate that information on a single anatomic template. The new procedure is based on developmental processes responsible for variations in normal human anatomy and is applicable to 3-D brain images in general, regardless of modality. Hybrid surface models known as Chen surfaces (based on superquadrics and spherical harmonics) are used to efficiently initialize 3-D active surfaces, and these then extract from both scans the developmentally fundamental surfaces of the ventricles and cortex. The construction of extremely complex surface deformation maps on the internal cortex is made easier by building a generic surface structure to model it. Connected systems of parametric meshes model several deep sulci whose trajectories represent critical functional boundaries. These sulci are sufficiently extended inside the brain to reflect subtle and distributed variations in neuroanatomy between subjects. The algorithm then calculates the high-dimensional volumetric warp (typically with 3842×256×3≈0.1 billion degrees of freedom) deforming one 3-D scan into structural correspondence with the other. Integral distortion functions are used to extend the deformation field required to elastically transform nested surfaces to their counterparts in the target scan. The algorithm's accuracy is tested, by warping 3-D magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} volumes from normal subjects and Alzheimer's patients, and by warping full-color 10243 digital cryosection volumes of the human head onto {MRI} volumes. Applications are discussed, including the transfer of multisubject 3-D functional, vascular, and histologic maps onto a single anatomic template; the mapping of 3-D brain atlases onto the scans of new subjects; and the rapid detection, quantification, and mapping of local shape changes in 3-D medical images in disease and during normal or abnormal growth and development},

This is followed by segmenting the gray matter from the spatially normalized images and smoothing the gray-matter segments. Voxel-wise parametric statistical tests which compare the smoothed gray-matter images from the two groups are performed. Corrections for multiple comparisons are made using the theory of Gaussian random fields. This paper describes the steps involved in {VBM}, with particular emphasis on segmenting gray matter from {MR} images with nonuniformity artifact. We provide evaluations of the assumptions that underpin the method, including the accuracy of the segmentation and the assumptions made about the statistical distribution of the data.},

We delineated the age-related changes in cortical thickness, regional {WM} volume, and diffusion characteristics and investigated the relationships between these properties of brain development. One hundred and sixty-eight healthy participants aged 8-30 years underwent {sMRI} and {DTI.} The results showed regional age-related cortical thinning, {WM} volume increases, and changes in diffusion parameters. Cortical thickness was the most strongly age-related parameter. All classes of measures showed unique associations with age. The results indicate that cortical thinning in adolescence cannot be explained by {WM} maturation in underlying regions as measured by volumetry or {DTI.} Moderate associations between cortical thickness and both volume and diffusion parameters in underlying {WM} regions were also found, although the relationships were not strong. It is concluded that none of the measures are redundant and that the integration of the 3 will yield a more complete understanding of brain maturation.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT.} Molecular biologic techniques are currently considered as new diagnostic and prognostic parameters with a sensitivity and specificity exceeding those of histologic and functional data currently used in clinical practice. The results in various clinical settings have been of limited value up to now. This study is an investigation of the use of tissue levels of {RNA} determined in routine clinical kidney biopsies as prognostic tools. The focus was on {RNA} encoding for molecules known to be involved in the pathogenesis of renal disorders. Fresh kidney biopsy tissue was obtained from 52 patients with various renal diseases. The {GFR} was followed for 12 mo. The extent of glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis in the biopsies was determined with quantitative digital image analysis. Glomerular and tubulointerstitial compartments from each biopsy specimen were separated, and {mRNA} levels of {TGF-}, collagen I, collagen {IV}, and fibronectin were quantitated by real-time {PCR.} Correlations, along with 95\% confidence intervals ({CI)}, between all variables tested at time biopsy were determined. To assess their prognostic value, these variables were correlated with the slope of {GFR} within several time intervals after biopsy. In addition, to evaluate the predictive value of the variables for outcome in individual patients, differences for each variable were tested between patients showing progressive decline in renal function (slope {GFR} {\textless} 0) and patients showing stable or improving renal function over time (slope {GFR} ≥ 0). In chronic renal diseases, the extent of histologic damage correlated with the {GFR} at the time of biopsy (r = -0.44; {CI} -0.68 to -0.11), but it did not correlate with the slope expressing a change in {GFR} after the biopsy. Tubulointerstitial {TGF-} {mRNA} levels correlated with the rate of change in {GFR} between time of biopsy and 1 mo later (r = 0.41; {CI}, 0.07 to 0.67). The {GFR} at the time of biopsy correlated with the slope of change in {GFR} between time of biopsy and 12 mo later (r = -0.50; {CI}, -0.73 to -0.18). In chronic renal diseases, glomerular fibronectin {mRNA} levels, in comparison with the {GFR} at time of biopsy, correlated relatively strongly with the slope of change in {GFR} between 3 and 12 mo (r = 0.50; {CI}, 0.16 to 0.74). Patients with favorable renal outcome after 12 mo showed significantly higher {TGF-} {mRNA} levels and lower proteinuria levels at time of biopsy (P {\textless} 0.05) than patients with a progressive decline in renal function. This study shows that {mRNA} levels measured in kidney biopsies can function as prognostic tools in human renal diseases. In particular, relatively high levels of tubulointerstitial {TGF-} {mRNA} and glomerular fibronectin {mRNA} are associated with less deterioration in renal function. E-mail: {M.Eikmans@LUMC.NL}},

Coefficients of variation ({CVs)} of diffusion-derived tract values were used to assess the microstructural reproducibility. Spatial correlation and fibre overlap were used to assess the architectural reproducibility. {RESULTS:} Spatial correlation was 68 \% for the {CST} and {AF}, and 69 \% for the {AFl.} Overlap was 69 \% for the {CST}, 61 \% for the {AF}, and 59 \% for the {AFl.} This was comparable to 2-mm tract shift variability. {CVs} of diffusion-derived tract values were at most 3.4 \%. {CONCLUSIONS:} The results showed low architectural and microstructural variability for the reconstruction of the tracts. The architectural reproducibility results encourage the further investigation of the use of {DTI-FT} for neurosurgical planning. The high microstructural reproducibility results are promising for using {DTI-FT} in neurology to assess or predict functional recovery. {KEY} {POINTS:} • Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor fibre tractography is increasingly used in the neurosciences. • The architectural reproducibility of fibre pathways can be up to 69 \%. • However the microstructural variability of fibre pathways is only 3.4 \% at most. • The architectural reproducibility results encourage the use of {DTI-FT} for neurosurgery. • The microstructural reproducibility results support the use of {DTI-FT} in neurology.},

	abstract = {Gyrification is the process by which the brain undergoes changes in surface morphology to create sulcal and gyral regions. The period of greatest development of brain gyrification is during the third trimester of pregnancy, a period of time in which the brain undergoes considerable growth. Little is known about changes in gyrification during childhood and adolescence, although considering the changes in gray matter volume and thickness during this time period, it is conceivable that alterations in the brain surface morphology could also occur during this period of development. The formation of gyri and sulci in the brain allows for compact wiring that promotes and enhances efficient neural processing. If cerebral function and form are linked through the organization of neural connectivity, then alterations in neural connectivity, i.e., synaptic pruning, may also alter the gyral and sulcal patterns of the brain. This paper reviews developmental theories of gyrification, computational techniques for measuring gyrification, and the potential interaction between gyrification and neuronal connectivity. We also present recent findings involving alterations in gyrification during childhood and adolescence.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in statistics have spawned powerful methods for regression and data decomposition that promote sparsity, a property that facilitates interpretation of the results. Sparse models use a small subset of the available variables and may perform as well or better than their full counterparts if constructed carefully. In most medical applications, models are required to have both good statistical performance and a relevant clinical interpretation to be of value. Morphometry of the corpus callosum is one illustrative example. This paper presents a method for relating spatial features to clinical outcome data. A set of parsimonious variables is extracted using sparse principal component analysis, producing simple yet characteristic features. The relation of these variables with clinical data is then established using a regression model. The result may be visualized as patterns of anatomical variation related to clinical outcome. In the present application, landmark-based shape data of the corpus callosum is analyzed in relation to age, gender, and clinical tests of walking speed and verbal fluency. To put the data-driven sparse principal component method into perspective, we consider two alternative techniques, one where features are derived using a model-based wavelet approach, and one where the original variables are regressed directly on the outcome.},

The perfusion signal is then usually extracted by averaging across the repetitions. But the sample mean is very sensitive to outliers. A single incorrect observation can therefore be the source of strong detrimental effects on the perfusion-weighted image estimated with the sample mean.
We propose to estimate robust {ASL} {CBF} maps with M-estimators to overcome the deleterious effects of outliers. The behaviour of this method is compared to z-score thresholding as recommended in [1]. Validation on simulated and real data is provided. Quantitative validation is undertaken by measuring the correlation with the most widespread technique to measure perfusion with {MRI:} Dynamic Susceptibility weighted Contrast imaging.},

	abstract = {Brain structural and functional development, throughout childhood and into adulthood, underlies the maturation of increasingly sophisticated cognitive abilities. High-level attentional and cognitive control processes rely on the integrity of, and dynamic interactions between, core neurocognitive networks. The right fronto-insular cortex ({rFIC)} is a critical component of a salience network ({SN)} that mediates interactions between large-scale brain networks involved in externally oriented attention [central executive network ({CEN)]} and internally oriented cognition [default mode network ({DMN)].} How these systems reconfigure and mature with development is a critical question for cognitive neuroscience, with implications for neurodevelopmental pathologies affecting brain connectivity. Using functional and effective connectivity measures applied to {fMRI} data, we examine interactions within and between the {SN}, {CEN}, and {DMN.} We find that functional coupling between key network nodes is stronger in adults than in children, as are causal links emanating from the {rFIC.} Specifically, the causal influence of the {rFIC} on nodes of the {SN} and {CEN} was significantly greater in adults compared with children. Notably, these results were entirely replicated on an independent dataset of matched children and adults. Developmental changes in functional and effective connectivity were related to structural connectivity along these links. Diffusion tensor imaging tractography revealed increased structural integrity in adults compared with children along both within- and between-network pathways associated with the {rFIC.} These results suggest that structural and functional maturation of {rFIC} pathways is a critical component of the process by which human brain networks mature during development to support complex, flexible cognitive processes in adulthood.},

	abstract = {One of the most challenging problems in modern neuroimaging is detailed characterization of neurodegeneration. Quantifying spatial and longitudinal atrophy patterns is an important component of this process. These spatiotemporal signals will aid in discriminating between related diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia ({FTD)} and Alzheimer's disease ({AD)}, which manifest themselves in the same at-risk population. Here, we develop a novel symmetric image normalization method ({SyN)} for maximizing the cross-correlation within the space of diffeomorphic maps and provide the Euler-Lagrange equations necessary for this optimization. We then turn to a careful evaluation of our method. Our evaluation uses gold standard, human cortical segmentation to contrast {SyN's} performance with a related elastic method and with the standard {ITK} implementation of Thirion's Demons algorithm. The new method compares favorably with both approaches, in particular when the distance between the template brain and the target brain is large. We then report the correlation of volumes gained by algorithmic cortical labelings of {FTD} and control subjects with those gained by the manual rater. This comparison shows that, of the three methods tested, {SyN's} volume measurements are the most strongly correlated with volume measurements gained by expert labeling. This study indicates that {SyN}, with cross-correlation, is a reliable method for normalizing and making anatomical measurements in volumetric {MRI} of patients and at-risk elderly individuals.},

Here, we report and evaluate a recent product of this commitment: Advanced Neuroimaging Tools ({ANTs)}, which is approaching its 2.0 release. The {ANTs} open source software library consists of a suite of state-of-the-art image registration, segmentation and template building tools for quantitative morphometric analysis. In this work, we use {ANTs} to quantify, for the first time, the impact of similarity metrics on the affine and deformable components of a template-based normalization study. We detail the {ANTs} implementation of three similarity metrics: squared intensity difference, a new and faster cross-correlation, and voxel-wise mutual information. We then use two-fold cross-validation to compare their performance on openly available, manually labeled, T1-weighted {MRI} brain image data of 40 subjects ({UCLA's} {LPBA40} dataset). We report evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for both the affine and deformable components of the registration. Results indicate that the best {ANTs} methods are competitive with existing brain extraction results (Jaccard=0.958) and cortical labeling approaches. Mutual information affine mapping combined with cross-correlation diffeomorphic mapping gave the best cortical labeling results (Jaccard=0.669±0.022). Furthermore, our two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify the similarity of templates derived from different subgroups. Our open code, data and evaluation scripts set performance benchmark parameters for this state-of-the-art toolkit. This is the first study to use a consistent transformation framework to provide a reproducible evaluation of the isolated effect of the similarity metric on optimal template construction and brain labeling.},

These predictions have relied on an assumption that the responses of the canals can be determined from their dimensions, and that an organism's behavior can be determined from these responses. However, the relationship between a canal's sensitivity and its size is not well known. An intraspecies comparison among canal responses in each of three species (cat, squirrel monkey, and pigeon) was undertaken to evaluate various models of canal function and determine how their dimensions may be related to afferent physiology. All models predicted the responses of the cat afferents, but the models performed less well for squirrel monkey and pigeon. Possible causes for this discrepancy include incorrectly assuming that afferent responses accurately represent canal function or errors in current biophysical models of the canals. These findings leave open the question as to how reliably canal anatomy can be used to estimate afferent responses and how closely afferent responses are related to behavior. Other labyrinthine features, such as orientation of the horizontal canal, which is reliably held near earth-horizontal across many species, may be better to use when extrapolating the posture and related behavior of extinct animals from labyrinthine morphology.},

We examined the utility of distinguishing between patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration ({FTLD)} and Alzheimer disease ({AD)} using quantitative cerebral blood flow ({CBF)} imaging with arterial spin labeled ({ASL)} perfusion {MRI.}


{METHODS}

Forty-two patients with {FTLD} and 18 patients with {AD}, defined by autopsy or {CSF-derived} biomarkers for {AD}, and 23 matched controls were imaged with a continuous {ASL} method to quantify {CBF} maps covering the entire brain.


{RESULTS}

Patients with {FTLD} and {AD} showed distinct patterns of hypoperfusion and hyperperfusion. Compared with controls, patients with {FTLD} showed significant hypoperfusion in regions of the frontal lobe bilaterally, and hyperperfusion in posterior cingulate and medial parietal/precuneus regions. Compared with controls, patients with {AD} showed significant hypoperfusion in the medial parietal/precuneus and lateral parietal cortex, and hyperperfusion in regions of the frontal lobe. Direct comparison of patient groups showed significant inferior, medial, and dorsolateral frontal hypoperfusion in {FTLD}, and significant hypoperfusion in bilateral lateral temporal-parietal and medial parietal/precuneus regions in {AD.}


{CONCLUSIONS}

Doubly dissociated areas of hypoperfusion in {FTLD} and {AD} are consistent with areas of significant histopathologic burden in these groups. {ASL} is a potentially useful biomarker for distinguishing patients with these neurodegenerative diseases.},

	abstract = {We propose a new information-theoretic metric, the symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence ({sKL-divergence)}, to measure the difference between two water diffusivity profiles in high angular resolution diffusion imaging ({HARDI).} Water diffusivity profiles are modeled as probability density functions on the unit sphere, and the {sKL-divergence} is computed from a spherical harmonic series, which greatly reduces computational complexity. Adjustment of the orientation of diffusivity functions is essential when the image is being warped, so we propose a fast algorithm to determine the principal direction of diffusivity functions using principal component analysis ({PCA).} We compare {sKL-divergence} with other inner-product based cost functions using synthetic samples and real {HARDI} data, and show that the {sKL-divergence} is highly sensitive in detecting small differences between two diffusivity profiles and therefore shows promise for applications in the nonlinear registration and multisubject statistical analysis of {HARDI} data.},

This paper shows that if the objects of interest are sparse in a fixed basis or compressible, then it is possible to reconstruct f to within very high accuracy from a small number of random measurements by solving a simple linear program.

In this study we show how mechanical stress perturbs the intracellular structures of the cell and induces mechanical responses. In order to correlate mechanical perturbations to cellular responses, we used a combined fluorescence-atomic force microscope ({AFM)} to produce well defined nanomechanical perturbations of 10 {nN} while simultaneously tracking the real-time motion of fluorescently labelled mitochondria in live cells. The spatial displacement of the organelles in response to applied loads demonstrates the highly dynamic mechanical response of mitochondria in fibroblast cells. The average displacement of all mitochondrial structures analysed showed an increase of approximately 40\%, post-perturbation ( approximately 160 nm in comparison to basal displacements of approximately 110 nm). These results show that local forces can produce organelle displacements at locations far from the initial point of contact (up to approximately 40 microm). In order to examine the role of the cytoskeleton in force transmission and its effect on mitochondrial displacements, both the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton were disrupted using Cytochalasin D and Nocodazole, respectively. Our results show that there is no significant change in mitochondrial displacement following indentation after such treatments. These results demonstrate the role of the cytoskeleton in force transmission through the cell and on mitochondrial displacements. In addition, it is suggested that care must be taken when performing mechanical experiments on living cells with the {AFM}, as these local mechanical perturbations may have significant structural and even biochemical effects on the cell.},

	volume = {20},
	abstract = {The finite mixture ({FM)} model is the most commonly used model for statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance ({MR)} images because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise constant nature of ideal brain {MR} images. However, being a histogram-based model, the {FM} has an intrinsic limitation-no spatial information is taken into account. This causes the {FM} model to work only on well-defined images with low levels of noise; unfortunately, this is often not the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias field distortion. Under these conditions, {FM} model-based methods produce unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel hidden Markov random field ({HMRF)} model, which is a stochastic process generated by a {MRF} whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which can be indirectly estimated through observations. Mathematically, it can be shown that the {FM} model is a degenerate version of the {HMRF} model. The advantage of the {HMRF} model derives from the way in which the spatial information is encoded through the mutual influences of neighboring sites. Although {MRF} modeling has been employed in {MR} image segmentation by other researchers, most reported methods are limited to using {MRF} as a general prior in an {FM} model-based approach. To fit the {HMRF} model, an {EM} algorithm is used. We show that by incorporating both the {HMRF} model and the {EM} algorithm into a {HMRF-EM} framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be achieved. More importantly, the {HMRF-EM} framework can easily be combined with other techniques. As an example, we show how the bias field correction algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997) can be incorporated into this framework to achieve a three-dimensional fully automated approach for brain {MR} image segmentation.},

	abstract = {In many multivariate statistical techniques, a set of linear functions of the original p variables is produced. One of the more difficult aspects of these techniques is the interpretation of the linear functions, as these functions usually have nonzero coefficients on all p variables. A common approach is to effectively ignore (treat as zero) any coefficients less than some threshold value, so that the function becomes simple and the interpretation becomes easier for the users. Such a procedure can be misleading. There are alternatives to principal component analysis which restrict the coefficients to a smaller number of possible values in the derivation of the linear functions, or replace the principal components by "principal variables." This article introduces a new technique, borrowing an idea proposed by Tibshirani in the context of multiple regression where similar problems arise in interpreting regression equations. This approach is the so-called {LASSO}, the "least absolute shrinkage and selection operator," in which a bound is introduced on the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients, and in which some coefficients consequently become zero. We explore some of the properties of the new technique, both theoretically and using simulation studies, and apply it to an example.},

Elastic Net regression controls via one parameter the number of voxels in the resulting model, and via another the degree to which correlated voxels are included. We find that this method produces highly predictive models of {fMRI} data that provide evidence for the distributed nature of neural function. We also use the flexibility of Elastic Net to demonstrate that model robustness can be improved without compromising predictability, in turn revealing the importance of localized clusters of activity.

T1 and T2 magnetic resonance images were acquired at both term equivalent and 7 years of age in 125 {VPT} and 25 {FT} children. Hippocampi were manually segmented and shape was characterized by boundary point distribution models at both time-points. Memory and learning outcomes were measured at 7 years of age. The {VPT} group demonstrated less hippocampal infolding than the {FT} group at 7 years. Hippocampal growth between infancy and 7 years was less in the {VPT} compared with the {FT} group, but the change in shape was similar between groups. There was little evidence that the measures of hippocampal development were related to memory and learning impairments in the {VPT} group. This study suggests that the developmental trajectory of the human hippocampus is altered in {VPT} children, but this does not predict memory and learning impairment. Further research is required to elucidate the mechanisms for memory and learning difficulties in {VPT} children. Hum Brain Mapp, 2014. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Visual acuity and motion perception are degraded during head movements unless the eyes counter-rotate so as to stabilize the line of sight and the retinal image. The vestibulo-ocular reflex ({VOR)} is assumed to produce this ocular counter-rotation. Consistent with this assumption, oscillopsia is a common complaint of patients with bilateral vestibular weakness. Shanidze et al. recently described compensatory eye movements in normal guinea pigs that appear to anticipate self-generated head movements. These responses effectively stabilize gaze and occur independently of the vestibular system. These new findings suggest that the {VOR} stabilizes gaze during passive perturbations of the head in space, but anticipatory responses may supplement or even supplant the {VOR} during actively generated head movements. This report reviews these findings, potential neurophysiological mechanisms, and their potential application to human clinical treatment of patients with vestibular disease.},

	abstract = {Arterial-spin-labeling ({ASL)} magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} provides a noninvasive tool to measure cerebral blood flow ({CBF)} and is increasingly used as a surrogate for baseline neural activity. However, the power of {ASL} {MRI} in detecting {CBF} differences between patient and control subjects is hampered by inter-subject variations in global {CBF}, which are associated with non-neural factors and may contribute to the noise in the across-group comparison. Here, we investigated the sensitivity of this technique and proposed a normalization strategy to better detect such a difference. A “model” situation was employed in which two visual stimuli (i.e. cross fixation and flashing checkerboard) were presented to two groups of subjects to mimic “control” and “patient” groups (N=7 for each group), respectively. It was found that absolute {CBF} ({aCBF)} in the occipital lobe in the checkerboard group was 26.0\% greater compared to the fixation group, but the level of significance was modest (P=.03). In contrast, when normalizing the {CBF} with whole-brain {CBF} or {CBF} in a reference region [termed relative {CBF} ({rCBF)]}, the statistical significance was improved considerably (P\&lt;.003). For voxel-based analysis, the {rCBF} indices correctly detected {CBF} differences in the occipital lobe in the across-group comparison, while {aCBF} failed to detect any significant cluster using the same statistical threshold. We also performed Monte Carlo simulation to confirm the experimental findings and found that the power improvement was most pronounced when signal-to-noise-ratio is moderate and the underlying {CBF} difference was small. The simulation also showed that, with the proposed normalization, a detection power of 80\% can be achieved using a sample size of about 20. In summary, {rCBF} is a more sensitive index to detect small differences in {CBF}, rather than the much-sought-after {aCBF}, since it reduces data noise caused by inter-subject variations in global {CBF.}},

	volume = {99},
	abstract = {Principal component analysis ({PCA)} is a widely used tool for data analysis and dimension reduction in applications throughout science and engineering. However, the principal components ({PCs)} can sometimes be difficult to interpret, because they are linear combinations of all the original variables. To facilitate interpretation, sparse {PCA} produces modified {PCs} with sparse loadings, i.e. loadings with very few non-zero elements. In this paper, we propose a new sparse {PCA} method, namely sparse {PCA} via regularized {SVD} ({sPCA-rSVD).} We use the connection of {PCA} with singular value decomposition ({SVD)} of the data matrix and extract the {PCs} through solving a low rank matrix approximation problem. Regularization penalties are introduced to the corresponding minimization problem to promote sparsity in {PC} loadings. An efficient iterative algorithm is proposed for computation. Two tuning parameter selection methods are discussed. Some theoretical results are established to justify the use of {sPCA-rSVD} when only the data covariance matrix is available. In addition, we give a modified definition of variance explained by the sparse {PCs.} The {sPCA-rSVD} provides a uniform treatment of both classical multivariate data and high-dimension-low-sample-size ({HDLSS)} data. Further understanding of {sPCA-rSVD} and some existing alternatives is gained through simulation studies and real data examples, which suggests that {sPCA-rSVD} provides competitive results. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Fiber bundles in {DT} images, however, comprise tensors that can inherently lie on more-complex manifolds. Unlike {FCM-based} schemes, the proposed method relies on modeling the manifolds underlying the classes by incorporating nonparametric data-driven statistical models. It produces an optimal fuzzy segmentation by maximizing a novel information-theoretic energy in a Markov-random-field framework. For {DT} images, the paper describes a consistent statistical technique for nonparametric modeling in Riemannian {DT} spaces that incorporates two very recent works. In this way, the proposed method provides uncertainties in the segmentation decisions, which stem from imaging artifacts including noise, partial voluming, and inhomogeneity. The paper shows results on synthetic and real, {DT} as well as {MR} images.},

The fundamental assumption of our fiber segmentation technique is that adjacent voxels in a tract have similar properties of diffusion. The fiber segmentation is carried out with a front propagation algorithm constructed to fill the whole fiber tract. The front is a {3D} surface that evolves with a propagation speed proportional to a measure indicating the similarity of diffusion between the tensors lying on the surface and their neighbors in the direction of propagation. We use a level set implementation to assure a stable and accurate evolution of the surface and to handle changes of topology of the surface during the evolution process. The fiber tract segmentation method does not need a regularized tensor field since the surface is automatically smoothed as it propagates. The smoothing is done by an intrinsic surface force, based on the minimal principal curvature. This segmentation can be used for obtaining quantitative measures of the diffusion in the fiber tracts and it can also be used for white matter registration and for surgical planning.},

	abstract = {We present a new unsupervised method to learn unified probabilistic object models ({POMs)} which can be applied to classification, segmentation, and recognition. We formulate this as a structure learning task and our strategy is to learn and combine basic {POM's} that make use of complementary image cues. Each {POM} has algorithms for inference and parameter learning, but: (i) the structure of each {POM} is unknown, and (ii) the inference and parameter learning algorithm for a {POM} may be impractical without additional information. We address these problems by a novel structure induction procedure which uses knowledge propagation to enable {POM's} to provide information to other {POM's} and "teach them" (which greatly reduced the amount of supervision required for training). In particular, we learn a {POM-IP} defined on interest points using weak supervision [1, 2] and use this to train a {POM-} mask, defined on regional features, which yields a combined {POM} which performs segmentation/localization. This combined model can be used to train {POM-edgelets}, defined on edgelets, which gives a full {POM} with improved performance on classification. We give detailed experimental analysis on large datasets which show that the full {POM} is invariant to scale and rotation of the object (for learning and inference) and performs inference rapidly. In addition, we show that we can apply {POM's} to learn objects classes (i.e. when there are several objects and the identity of the object in each image is unknown). We emphasize that these models can match between different objects from the same category and hence enable object recognition.},

	abstract = {Summary: Accuracy in in vivo quantitation of brain function with positron emission tomography ({PET)} has often been limited by partial volume effects. This limitation becomes prominent in studies of aging and degenerative brain diseases where partial volume effects vary with different degrees of atrophy. The present study describes how the actual gray matter ({GM)} tracer concentration can be estimated using an algorithm that relates the regional fraction of {GM} to partial volume effects. The regional fraction of {GM} was determined by magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI).} The procedure is designated as {GM} {PET.} In computer simulations and phantom studies, the {GM} {PET} algorithm permitted a 100\% recovery of the actual tracer concentration in neocortical {GM} and hippocampus, irrespective of the {GM} volume. {GM} {PET} was applied in a test case of temporal lobe epilepsy revealing an increase in radiotracer activity in {GM} that was undetected in the {PET} image before correction for partial volume effects. In computer simulations, errors in the segmentation of {GM} and errors in registration of {PET} and {MRI} images resulted in less than 15\% inaccuracy in the {GM} {PET} image. In conclusion, {GM} {PET} permits accurate determination of the actual radiotracer concentration in human brain {GM} in vivo. The method differentiates whether a change in the apparent radiotracer concentration reflects solely an alteration in {GM} volume or rather a change in radiotracer concentration per unit volume of {GM.}},

Contrast media are indispensable to more clearly differentiate anatomic structures and to detect and characterize abnormalities. Depending on the indication up to 200 ml of these agents are injected during {CT.} Despite these large amounts adverse effects are rare and have further decreased with the introduction of non-ionic substances. However, it took 10 to 20 years until these non-ionic agents replaced the older ionic agents in clinical practice. In recent years no new substance has been brought to the market. The introduction of rapid scanning using multislice {CT} technology, however, has led to the development of more sophisticated contrast injection techniques. Current research focuses on optimizing contrast application techniques and on further evaluating the safety profiles of the various substances. The amount of contrast enhancement obtained in individual patients for instance depends on the contrast agent characteristics, such as iodine concentration, and the parameters of the contrast injection protocol, such as iodine flux and iodine dose. Meanwhile, contrast agent characteristics such as osmolality and viscosity play a role in the safety profile of an agent. This paper provides a current overview of {CT} contrast media, {CT} contrast dynamics, and {CT} contrast applications with a special focus on oncological imaging.},

	abstract = {Texture segmentation involves subdividing an image into differently textured regions. Many texture segmentation schemes are based on a filter-bank model, where the filters, called Gabor filters, are derived from Gabor elementary functions. The goal is to transform texture differences into detectable filter-output discontinuities at texture boundaries. By locating these discontinuities, one can segment the image into differently textured regions. Distinct discontinuities occur, however, only if the Gabor filter parameters are suitably chosen. Some previous analysis has shown how to design filters for discriminating simple textures. Designing filters for more general natural textures, though, has largely been done ad hoc. We have devised a more rigorously based method for designing Gabor filters. It assumes that an image contains two different textures and that prototype samples of the textures are given a priori. We argue that Gabor filter outputs can be modeled as Rician random variables (often approximated well as Gaussian rv's) and develop a decision-theoretic algorithm for selecting optimal filter parameters. To improve segmentations for difficult texture pairs, we also propose a multiple-filter segmentation scheme, motivated by the Rician model. Experimental results indicate that our method is superior to previous methods in providing useful Gabor filters for a wide range of texture pairs},

This study establishes that sparse canonical correlation analysis ({SCCAN)} identifies generalizable, structural {MRI-derived} cortical networks that relate to five distinct categories of cognition. We obtain multivariate psychometrics from the domain-specific sub-scales of the Philadelphia Brief Assessment of Cognition ({PBAC).} By using a training and separate testing stage, we find that {PBAC-defined} cognitive domains of language, visuospatial functioning, episodic memory, executive control, and social functioning correlate with unique and distributed areas of gray matter ({GM).} In contrast, a parallel univariate framework fails to identify, from the training data, regions that are also significant in the left-out test dataset. The cohort includes164 patients with Alzheimer's disease, behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia, semantic variant primary progressive aphasia, non-fluent/agrammatic primary progressive aphasia, or corticobasal syndrome. The analysis is implemented with open-source software for which we provide examples in the text. In conclusion, we show that multivariate techniques identify biologically-plausible brain regions supporting specific cognitive domains. The findings are identified in training data and confirmed in test data.},

	abstract = {Multivariate regression is increasingly used to study the relation between {fMRI} spatial activation patterns and experimental stimuli or behavioral ratings. With linear models, informative brain locations are identified by mapping the model coefficients. This is a central aspect in neuroimaging, as it provides the sought-after link between the activity of neuronal populations and subject's perception, cognition or behavior. Here, we show that mapping of informative brain locations using multivariate linear regression ({MLR)} may lead to incorrect conclusions and interpretations. {MLR} algorithms for high dimensional data are designed to deal with targets (stimuli or behavioral ratings, in {fMRI)} separately, and the predictive map of a model integrates information deriving from both neural activity patterns and experimental design. Not accounting explicitly for the presence of other targets whose associated activity spatially overlaps with the one of interest may lead to predictive maps of troublesome interpretation. We propose a new model that can correctly identify the spatial patterns associated with a target while achieving good generalization. For each target, the training is based on an augmented dataset, which includes all remaining targets. The estimation on such datasets produces both maps and interaction coefficients, which are then used to generalize. The proposed formulation is independent of the regression algorithm employed. We validate this model on simulated {fMRI} data and on a publicly available dataset. Results indicate that our method achieves high spatial sensitivity and good generalization and that it helps disentangle specific neural effects from interaction with predictive maps associated with other targets.

The construction of such models is difficult using current neuroimaging technology due to the high degree of cortical folding. Even single voxel misclassifications can result in erroneous connections being created between adjacent banks of a sulcus, resulting in a topologically inaccurate model. These topological defects cause the cortical model to no longer be homeomorphic to a sheet, preventing the accurate inflation, flattening, or spherical morphing of the reconstructed cortex. Surface deformation techniques can guarantee the topological correctness of a model, but are time-consuming and may result in geometrically inaccurate models. In order to address this need we have developed a technique for taking a model of the cortex, detecting and fixing the topological defects while leaving that majority of the model intact, resulting in a surface that is both geometrically accurate and topologically correct.},

In most medical applications, models are required to have both good statistical performance and a relevant clinical interpretation to be of value. Morphometry of the corpus callosum is one illustrative example. This paper presents a method for relating spatial features to clinical outcome data. A set of parsimonious variables is extracted using sparse principal component analysis, producing simple yet characteristic features. The relation of these variables with clinical data is then established using a regression model. The result may be visualized as patterns of anatomical variation related to clinical outcome. In the present application, landmark-based shape data of the corpus callosum is analyzed in relation to age, gender, and clinical tests of walking speed and verbal fluency. To put the data-driven sparse principal component method into perspective, we consider two alternative techniques, one where features are derived using a model-based wavelet approach, and one where the original variables are regressed directly on the outcome.},

Methods An International Harmonization Project ({IHP)} was convened to discuss standardization of clinical trial parameters in lymphoma. An imaging subcommittee developed consensus recommendations based on published {PET} literature and the collective expertise of its members in the use of {PET} in lymphoma. Only recommendations subsequently endorsed by all {IHP} subcommittees were adopted.
Recommendations {PET} after completion of therapy should be performed at least 3 weeks, and preferably at 6 to 8 weeks, after chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy, and 8 to 12 weeks after radiation or chemoradiotherapy. Visual assessment alone is adequate for interpreting {PET} findings as positive or negative when assessing response after completion of therapy. Mediastinal blood pool activity is recommended as the reference background activity to define {PET} positivity for a residual mass ≥ 2 cm in greatest transverse diameter, regardless of its location. A smaller residual mass or a normal sized lymph node (ie, ≤ 1 × 1 cm in diameter) should be considered positive if its activity is above that of the surrounding background. Specific criteria for defining {PET} positivity in the liver, spleen, lung, and bone marrow are also proposed. Use of attenuation-corrected {PET} is strongly encouraged. Use of {PET} for treatment monitoring during a course of therapy should only be done in a clinical trial or as part of a prospective registry.},

The {NMF} decomposition is not in general unique and a part based representation not guaranteed. However, imposing sparseness both improves the uniqueness of the decomposition and favors part based representation. Sparseness in the form of attaining as many zero elements in the solution as possible is appealing from a conceptional point of view and corresponds to minimizing reconstruction error with an L$_{\textrm{0}}$ norm constraint. In general, solving for a given L$_{\textrm{0}}$ norm is an {NP} hard problem thus convex relaxation to regularization by the L$_{\textrm{1}}$ norm is often considered, i.e., minimizing (1/2{\textbar}{\textbar}V - {WH{\textbar}{\textbar}$_{\textrm{F}}$} $^{\textrm{2}}$ + lambda{\textbar}{\textbar}H{\textbar}{\textbar}$_{\textrm{1}}${).An} open problem is to control the degree of sparsity lambda imposed. We here demonstrate that a full regularization path for the L$_{\textrm{1}}$ norm regularized least squares {NMF} for fixed W can be calculated at the cost of an ordinary least squares solution based on a modification of the least angle regression and selection ({LARS)} algorithm forming a non-negativity constrained {LARS} ({NLARS).} With the full regularization path, the L$_{\textrm{1}}$ regularization strength lambda that best approximates a given L$_{\textrm{0}}$ can be directly accessed and in effect used to control the sparsity of H.

	abstract = {Inverse inference, or "brain reading", is a recent paradigm for analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI)} data, based on pattern recognition tools. By predicting some cognitive variables related to brain activation maps, this approach aims at decoding brain activity. Inverse inference takes into account the multivariate information between voxels and is currently the only way to assess how precisely some cognitive information is encoded by the activity of neural populations within the whole brain. However, it relies on a prediction function that is plagued by the curse of dimensionality, as we have far more features than samples, i.e., more voxels than {fMRI} volumes. To address this problem, different methods have been proposed. Among them are univariate feature selection, feature agglomeration and regularization techniques. In this paper, we consider a hierarchical structured regularization. Specifically, the penalization we use is constructed from a tree that is obtained by spatially constrained agglomerative clustering. This approach encodes the spatial prior information in the regularization process, which makes the overall prediction procedure more robust to inter-subject variability. We test our algorithm on a real data acquired for studying the mental representation of objects, and we show that the proposed algorithm yields better prediction accuracy than reference methods. © 2011 {IEEE.}},

Additionally, images were tested for regions with significant mismatch of the {CBF} and {GM} differences between groups. {CBF} was significantly lower in the bilateral precuneus, parietal association cortex and the left inferior temporal lobe but was non-significantly increased in the hippocampus and other medial temporal structures.

Here, we examined whether this functional organization is disrupted in Alzheimer's disease ({AD).} Task-free {fMRI} data from 21 {AD} subjects and 18 age-matched controls were obtained. Wavelet analysis was applied to the {fMRI} data to compute frequency-dependent correlation matrices. Correlation matrices were thresholded to create 90-node undirected-graphs of functional brain networks. Small-world metrics (characteristic path length and clustering coefficient) were computed using graph analytical methods. In the low frequency interval 0.01 to 0.05 Hz, functional brain networks in controls showed small-world organization of brain activity, characterized by a high clustering coefficient and a low characteristic path length. In contrast, functional brain networks in {AD} showed loss of small-world properties, characterized by a significantly lower clustering coefficient (p{\textless}0.01), indicative of disrupted local connectivity. Clustering coefficients for the left and right hippocampus were significantly lower (p{\textless}0.01) in the {AD} group compared to the control group. Furthermore, the clustering coefficient distinguished {AD} participants from the controls with a sensitivity of 72\% and specificity of 78\%. Our study provides new evidence that there is disrupted organization of functional brain networks in {AD.} Small-world metrics can characterize the functional organization of the brain in {AD}, and our findings further suggest that these network measures may be useful as an imaging-based biomarker to distinguish {AD} from healthy aging. © 2008 Supekar et al.},

	abstract = {The exact mechanisms leading to Alzheimer's disease ({AD)} are largely unknown, limiting the identification of effective disease-modifying therapies. The two principal neuropathological hallmarks of {AD} are extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ), peptide deposition (senile plaques) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles containing hyperphosphorylated tau protein. During the last decade, most of the efforts of the pharmaceutical industry were directed against the production and accumulation of Aβ. The most innovative of the pharmacological approaches was the stimulation of Aβ clearance from the brain of {AD} patients via the administration of Aβ antigens (active vaccination) or anti-Aβ antibodies (passive vaccination). Several active and passive anti-Aβ vaccines are under clinical investigation. Unfortunately, the first active vaccine ({AN1792}, consisting of preaggregate Aβ and an immune adjuvant, {QS-21)} was abandoned because it caused meningoencephalitis in approximately 6\% of treated patients. Anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies (bapineuzumab and solanezumab) are now being developed. The clinical results of the initial studies with bapineuzumab were equivocal in terms of cognitive benefit. The occurrence of vasogenic edema after bapineuzumab, and more rarely brain microhemorrhages (especially in Apo E ε4 carriers), has raised concerns on the safety of these antibodies directed against the N-terminus of the Aβ peptide. Solanezumab, a humanized anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody directed against the midregion of the Aβ peptide, was shown to neutralize soluble Aβ species. Phase {II} studies showed a good safety profile of solanezumab, while studies on cerebrospinal and plasma biomarkers documented good signals of pharmacodynamic activity. Although some studies suggested that active immunization may be effective against tau in animal models of {AD}, very few studies regarding passive immunization against tau protein are currently available. The results of the large, ongoing Phase {III} trials with bapineuzumab and solanezumab will tell us if monoclonal anti-Aβ antibodies may slow down the rate of deterioration of {AD.} Based on the new diagnostic criteria of {AD} and on recent major failures of anti-Aβ drugs in mild-to-moderate {AD} patients, one could argue that clinical trials on potential disease-modifying drugs, including immunological approaches, should be performed in the early stages of {AD.}},

The cross-validation estimate of prediction error is nearly unbiased but can be highly variable. Here we discuss bootstrap estimates of prediction error, which can be thought of as smoothed versions of cross-validation. We show that a particular bootstrap method, the .632+ rule, substantially outperforms cross-validation in a catalog of 24 simulation experiments. Besides providing point estimates, we also consider estimating the variability of an error rate estimate. All of the results here are nonparametric and apply to any possible prediction rule; however, we study only classification problems with 0–1 loss in detail. Our simulations include “smooth” prediction rules like Fisher's linear discriminant function and unsmooth ones like nearest neighbors.},

	abstract = {Accurate prediction of clinical changes of mild cognitive impairment ({MCI)} patients, including both qualitative change (i.e., conversion to Alzheimer's disease ({AD))} and quantitative change (i.e., cognitive scores) at future time points, is important for early diagnosis of {AD} and for monitoring the disease progression. In this paper, we propose to predict future clinical changes of {MCI} patients by using both baseline and longitudinal multimodality data. To do this, we first develop a longitudinal feature selection method to jointly select brain regions across multiple time points for each modality. Specifically, for each time point, we train a sparse linear regression model by using the imaging data and the corresponding clinical scores, with an extra 'group regularization' to group the weights corresponding to the same brain region across multiple time points together and to allow for selection of brain regions based on the strength of multiple time points jointly. Then, to further reflect the longitudinal changes on the selected brain regions, we extract a set of longitudinal features from the original baseline and longitudinal data. Finally, we combine all features on the selected brain regions, from different modalities, for prediction by using our previously proposed multi-kernel {SVM.} We validate our method on 88 {ADNI} {MCI} subjects, with both {MRI} and {FDG-PET} data and the corresponding clinical scores (i.e., {MMSE} and {ADAS-Cog)} at 5 different time points. We first predict the clinical scores ({MMSE} and {ADAS-Cog)} at 24-month by using the multimodality data at previous time points, and then predict the conversion of {MCI} to {AD} by using the multimodality data at time points which are at least 6-month ahead of the conversion. The results on both sets of experiments show that our proposed method can achieve better performance in predicting future clinical changes of {MCI} patients than the conventional methods.},

	abstract = {Thoracic spine flexibility affects head motion, which is critical to control in motor vehicle crashes given the frequency and severity of head injuries. The objective of this study is to investigate the dynamic response of the human upper thoracic region. An original experimental/analytical approach, Isolated Segment Manipulation ({ISM)}, is introduced to quantify the intact upper thoracic spine-pectoral girdle ({UTS-PG)} dynamic response of six adult post-mortem human subjects ({PMHS).} A continuous series of small displacement, frontal perturbations were applied to the human {UTS-PG} using fifteen combinations of speed and constraint per {PMHS.} The non-parametric response of the T1-T6 lumped mass segment was obtained using a system identification technique. A parametric mass-damper-spring model was used to fit the non-parametric system response. Mechanical parameters of the upper thoracic spine were determined from the experimental model and analyzed in each speed/constraint configuration. The natural frequencies of the {UTS-PG} were 22.9 ± 7.1 rad/sec (shear, n=58), 32.1 ± 7.4 rad/sec (axial, n=58), and 27.8 ± 7.7 rad/sec (rotation, n=65). The damping ratios were 0.25 ± 0.20 (shear), 0.42 ± 0.24 (axial), and 0.58± 0.32 (rotation). N-way analysis of variance (Type {III} constrained sum of squares, no interaction effects) revealed that the relative effects of test speed, pectoral girdle constraint, and {PMHS} anthropometry on the {UTS-PG} dynamic properties varied per property and direction. While more work is needed to verify accuracy in realistic crash scenarios, the {UTS-PG} model system dynamic properties could eventually aid in developing integrated anthropomorphic test device ({ATD)} thoracic spine and shoulder components to provide improved head kinematics and belt interaction.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} This prospective study employs anisotropic diffusion-weighted ({ADW)} magnetic resonance imaging for the integration of individual spatial information concerning the principal motor pathways into the operating room during microneurosurgery in the central region. We hypothesize that the three-dimensional (3-D) visualization of the pyramidal tract position ({PTV)} in a neuronavigation system based on {ADW} provides valid information concerning the position and extension of the principal motor pathways. {METHODS} A total of 13 consecutive patients with lesions adjacent to the pyramidal tracts and the central region underwent microneurosurgery with the help of pyramidal tract visualization ({PTV).} An {ADW} sequence obtained preoperatively was fused to an anatomic navigation sequence. The 3-D reconstructions of the precentral gyrus ({PG)}, the pyramidal tract, and the tumor were available in a customized neuronavigation system during surgery. Intraoperatively the {PG} was identified on the basis of the aforementioned data. Electric motorcortex stimulation ({CS)} was used to directly verify the {PG} location and indirectly the fiber tract position. {RESULTS} In 11 cases (92\%) the prediction of the principal motor pathways' position was correct. In one case of a meningioma, according to {PTV}, the tumor was falsely localized postcentrally. In the case of a precentral cavernoma, no motor response could be elicited by cortical stimulation. {CONCLUSION} Intraoperative {PTV} on the basis of {ADW} provides the neurosurgeon with reliable information concerning the position of the principal motor pathways during intracranial procedures as proved with intraoperative electrophysiological testing. The technique has the potential to reduce operative morbidity. {PTV} is straightforward and can be adapted to other customized neuronavigation devices.},

	abstract = {We propose an automatic four-chamber heart segmentation system for the quantitative functional analysis of the heart from cardiac computed tomography ({CT)} volumes. Two topics are discussed: heart modeling and automatic model fitting to an unseen volume. Heart modeling is a nontrivial task since the heart is a complex nonrigid organ. The model must be anatomically accurate, allow manual editing, and provide sufficient information to guide automatic detection and segmentation. Unlike previous work, we explicitly represent important landmarks (such as the valves and the ventricular septum cusps) among the control points of the model. The control points can be detected reliably to guide the automatic model fitting process. Using this model, we develop an efficient and robust approach for automatic heart chamber segmentation in {3D} {CT} volumes. We formulate the segmentation as a two-step learning problem: anatomical structure localization and boundary delineation. In both steps, we exploit the recent advances in learning discriminative models. A novel algorithm, marginal space learning ({MSL)}, is introduced to solve the 9-D similarity transformation search problem for localizing the heart chambers. After determining the pose of the heart chambers, we estimate the {3D} shape through learning-based boundary delineation. The proposed method has been extensively tested on the largest dataset (with 323 volumes from 137 patients) ever reported in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, our system is the fastest with a speed of 4.0 s per volume (on a dual-core 3.2-{GHz} processor) for the automatic segmentation of all four chambers.},

To characterize the complexity of these folds and their relationship with neurological and psychiatric conditions, different techniques have been developed to quantify the folding patterns, also known as the surface complexity or gyrification of the brain. In this study, the authors propose a new geometric approach to measure the gyrification of human brains from magnetic resonance images. This approach is based on intrinsic {3D} measurements that relate the local brain surface area to the corresponding area of a tightly wrapped sheet. The authors also present an adaptation of this technique in which the geodesic depth is incorporated into the gyrification computation. These gyrification measures are efficiently and accurately computed by solving geometric partial differential equations. The presentation of the geometric framework is complemented with experimental results for brain complexity in typically developing children and adolescents. Using this novel approach, the authors provide evidence for a gradual decrease in brain surface complexity throughout childhood and adolescence. These developmental differences occur earlier in the occipital lobe and move anterior as children progress into young adulthood. Hum Brain Mapp, 2013. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Principal component analysis ({PCA)} is a widely used technique for data analysis and dimension reduction with numerous applications in science and engineering. However, the standard {PCA} suffers from the fact that the principal components ({PCs)} are usually linear combinations of all the original variables, and it is thus often difficult to interpret the {PCs.} To alleviate this drawback, various sparse {PCA} approaches were proposed in the literature (Cadima and Jolliffe in J Appl Stat 22:203–214, 1995 ; {d’Aspremont} et al. in J Mach Learn Res 9:1269–1294, 2008 ; {d’Aspremont} et al. {SIAM} Rev 49:434–448, 2007 ; Jolliffe in J Appl Stat 22:29–35, 1995 ; Journée et al. in J Mach Learn Res 11:517–553, 2010 ; Jolliffe et al. in J Comput Graph Stat 12:531–547, 2003 ; Moghaddam et al. in Advances in neural information processing systems 18:915–922, {MIT} Press, Cambridge, 2006 ; Shen and Huang in J Multivar Anal 99(6):1015–1034, 2008 ; Zou et al. in J Comput Graph Stat 15(2):265–286, 2006 ). Despite success in achieving sparsity, some important properties enjoyed by the standard {PCA} are lost in these methods such as uncorrelation of {PCs} and orthogonality of loading vectors. Also, the total explained variance that they attempt to maximize can be too optimistic. In this paper we propose a new formulation for sparse {PCA}, aiming at finding sparse and nearly uncorrelated {PCs} with orthogonal loading vectors while explaining as much of the total variance as possible. We also develop a novel augmented Lagrangian method for solving a class of nonsmooth constrained optimization problems, which is well suited for our formulation of sparse {PCA.} We show that it converges to a feasible point, and moreover under some regularity assumptions, it converges to a stationary point. Additionally, we propose two nonmonotone gradient methods for solving the augmented Lagrangian subproblems, and establish their global and local convergence. Finally, we compare our sparse {PCA} approach with several existing methods on synthetic (Zou et al. in J Comput Graph Stat 15(2):265–286, 2006 ), Pitprops (Jeffers in Appl Stat 16:225–236, 1967 ), and gene expression data (Chin et al in Cancer Cell {10:529C–541C}, 2006 ), respectively. The computational results demonstrate that the sparse {PCs} produced by our approach substantially outperform those by other methods in terms of total explained variance, correlation of {PCs}, and orthogonality of loading vectors. Moreover, the experiments on random data show that our method is capable of solving large-scale problems within a reasonable amount of time.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of automatically recognizing human faces from frontal views with varying expression and illumination, as well as occlusion and disguise. We cast the recognition problem as one of classifying among multiple linear regression models and argue that new theory from sparse signal representation offers the key to addressing this problem. Based on a sparse representation computed by C$^{\textrm{1}}$-minimization, we propose a general classification algorithm for (image-based) object recognition. This new framework provides new insights into two crucial issues in face recognition: feature extraction and robustness to occlusion. For feature extraction, we show that if sparsity in the recognition problem is properly harnessed, the choice of features is no longer critical. What is critical, however, is whether the number of features is sufficiently large and whether the sparse representation is correctly computed. Unconventional features such as downsampled images and random projections perform just as well as conventional features such as eigenfaces and Laplacianfaces, as long as the dimension of the feature space surpasses certain threshold, predicted by the theory of sparse representation. This framework can handle errors due to occlusion and corruption uniformly by exploiting the fact that these errors are often sparse with respect to the standard (pixel) basis. The theory of sparse representation helps predict how much occlusion the recognition algorithm can handle and how to choose the training images to maximize robustness to occlusion. We conduct extensive experiments on publicly available databases to verify the efficacy of the proposed algorithm and corroborate the above claims.},

	abstract = {In recent years there has been a growing interest in the study of sparse representation of signals. Using an overcomplete dictionary that contains prototype signal-atoms, signals are described by sparse linear combinations of these atoms. Applications that use sparse representation are many and include compression, regularization in inverse problems, feature extraction, and more. Recent activity in this field has concentrated mainly on the study of pursuit algorithms that decompose signals with respect to a given dictionary. Designing dictionaries to better fit the above model can be done by either selecting one from a prespecified set of linear transforms or adapting the dictionary to a set of training signals. Both of these techniques have been considered, but this topic is largely still open. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm for adapting dictionaries in order to achieve sparse signal representations. Given a set of training signals, we seek the dictionary that leads to the best representation for each member in this set, under strict sparsity constraints. We present a new method - the K-{SVD} algorithm - generalizing the K-means clustering process. K-{SVD} is an iterative method that alternates between sparse coding of the examples based on the current dictionary and a process of updating the dictionary atoms to better fit the data. The update of the dictionary columns is combined with an update of the sparse representations, thereby accelerating convergence. The K-{SVD} algorithm is flexible and can work with any pursuit method (e.g., basis pursuit, {FOCUSS}, or matching pursuit). We analyze this algorithm and demonstrate its results both on synthetic tests and in applications on real image data. © 2006 {IEEE.}},

Atropos is capable of incorporating spatial prior probability maps (sparse), prior label maps and/or Markov Random Field ({MRF)} modeling. Atropos has also been efficiently implemented to handle large quantities of possible labelings (in the experimental section, we use up to 69 classes) with a minimal memory footprint. This work describes the technical and implementation aspects of Atropos and evaluates its performance on two different ground-truth datasets. First, we use the {BrainWeb} dataset from Montreal Neurological Institute to evaluate three-tissue segmentation performance via (1) K-means segmentation without use of template data; (2) {MRF} segmentation with initialization by prior probability maps derived from a group template; (3) Prior-based segmentation with use of spatial prior probability maps derived from a group template. We also evaluate Atropos performance by using spatial priors to drive a 69-class {EM} segmentation problem derived from the Hammers atlas from University College London.

	abstract = {Network analysis is an emerging approach to functional connectivity in which the brain is construed as a graph and its connectivity and information processing estimated by mathematical characterizations of graphs. There has been little to no work examining the reproducibility of network metrics derived from different types of functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI)} data (e.g., resting vs. task related, or pulse sequences other than standard blood oxygen level dependent [{BOLD]} data) or of measures of network structure at levels other than summary statistics. Here, we take up these questions, comparing the reproducibility of graphs derived from resting arterial spin-labeling perfusion {fMRI} with those derived from {BOLD} scans collected while the participant was performing a task. We also examine the reproducibility of the anatomical connectivity implied by the graph by investigating test–retest consistency of the graphs’ edges. We compare two measures of graph-edge consistency both within versus between subjects and across data types. We find a dissociation in the reproducibility of network metrics, with metrics from resting data most reproducible at lower frequencies and metrics from task-related data most reproducible at higher frequencies; that same dissociation is not recapitulated, however, in network structure, for which the task-related data are most consistent at all frequencies. Implications for the practice of network analysis are discussed.},

{METHODS:} Six-hundred-and-forty patients (332 non-pregnant women and 308 men) aged 8-65 years underwent spinal anesthesia with Quincke {25G} or {27G} needles in elective surgery.
{RESULTS:} Forty-eight (7.5\%) of the patients developed {PDPH.} The binary logistic regression analysis identified as risk factors: gender [11.1\% female vs. 3.6\% male, {OR} 2.25 (1.07-4.73); p = 0.03], age [11.0\% 31-50 years of age vs. 4.2\% others, {OR} 2.21 (1.12-4.36); p = 0.02], previous history of {PDPH} [26.4\% positive vs. 6.2\% negative, {OR} 4.30 (1.99-9.31); p {\textless} 0.01] and bevel orientation [16.1\% perpendicular vs. 5.7\% parallel, {OR} 2.16 (1.07-4.35); p = 0.03]. The period of latency between lumbar puncture and headache onset range from 6 to 72 hours and the duration from 3 to 15 days. In 34/48 (71\%) patients with {PDPH}, at least one of the following was present: neck stiffness, tinnitus, hypoacusia, photophobia, or nausea.
{CONCLUSION:} In conclusion, 14/48 patients (29\%) suffered none of the above-mentioned symptoms, indicating that a significant number of patients may suffer from {PDPH} in the absence of any symptoms apart from the headache itself. This suggests that a further analyses of existing studies should be made to determine if a criteria change may need consideration.},

We propose an approach for image super-resolution by using anatomical intermodality priors from a reference image. Contrary to interpolation techniques, in order to be able to recover fine details in images, the reconstruction process is based on a physical model of image acquisition. Another contribution to this inverse problem is a new regularization approach that uses an example-based framework integrating non-local similarity constraints to handle in a better way repetitive structures and texture. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by experiments on realistic Brainweb Magnetic Resonance images and on clinical images from {ADNI}, generating automatically high-quality brain images from low-resolution input.},

	abstract = {In a sparse-representation-based face recognition scheme, the desired dictionary should have good representational power (i.e., being able to span the subspace of all faces) while supporting optimal discrimination of the classes (i.e., different human subjects). We propose a method to learn an over-complete dictionary that attempts to simultaneously achieve the above two goals. The proposed method, discriminative K-{SVD} (D-{KSVD)}, is based on extending the K-{SVD} algorithm by incorporating the classification error into the objective function, thus allowing the performance of a linear classifier and the representational power of the dictionary being considered at the same time by the same optimization procedure. The D-{KSVD} algorithm finds the dictionary and solves for the classifier using a procedure derived from the K-{SVD} algorithm, which has proven efficiency and performance. This is in contrast to most existing work that relies on iteratively solving sub-problems with the hope of achieving the global optimal through iterative approximation. We evaluate the proposed method using two commonly-used face databases, the Extended {YaleB} database and the {AR} database, with detailed comparison to 3 alternative approaches, including the leading state-of-the-art in the literature. The experiments show that the proposed method outperforms these competing methods in most of the cases. Further, using Fisher criterion and dictionary incoherence, we also show that the learned dictionary and the corresponding classifier are indeed better-posed to support sparse-representation-based recognition.},

	abstract = {We address the problem of the segmentation of cerebral white matter structures from diffusion tensor images ({DTI).} A {DTI} produces, from a set of diffusion-weighted {MR} images, tensor-valued images where each voxel is assigned with a 3 x 3 symmetric, positive-definite matrix. This second order tensor is simply the covariance matrix of a local Gaussian process, with zero-mean, modeling the average motion of water molecules. As we will show in this paper, the definition of a dissimilarity measure and statistics between such quantities is a nontrivial task which must be tackled carefully. We claim and demonstrate that, by using the theoretically well-founded differential geometrical properties of the manifold of multivariate normal distributions, it is possible to improve the quality of the segmentation results obtained with other dissimilarity measures such as the Euclidean distance or the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The main goal of this paper is to prove that the choice of the probability metric, i.e., the dissimilarity measure, has a deep impact on the tensor statistics and, hence, on the achieved results. We introduce a variational formulation, in the level-set framework, to estimate the optimal segmentation of a {DTI} according to the following hypothesis: Diffusion tensors exhibit a Gaussian distribution in the different partitions. We must also respect the geometric constraints imposed by the interfaces existing among the cerebral structures and detected by the gradient of the {DTI.} We show how to express all the statistical quantities for the different probability metrics. We validate and compare the results obtained on various synthetic data-sets, a biological rat spinal cord phantom and human brain {DTIs.}},

Because of the large number of genes and the complexity of biological networks, clustering is a useful exploratory technique for analysis of gene expression data. Other classical techniques, such as principal component analysis ({PCA)}, have also been applied to analyze gene expression data. Using different data analysis techniques and different clustering algorithms to analyze the same data set can lead to very different conclusions. Our goal is to study the effectiveness of principal components ({PCs)} in capturing cluster structure. Specifically, using both real and synthetic gene expression data sets, we compared the quality of clusters obtained from the original data to the quality of clusters obtained after projecting onto subsets of the principal component axes. Results: Our empirical study showed that clustering with the {PCs} instead of the original variables does not necessarily improve, and often degrades, cluster quality. In particular, the first few {PCs} (which contain most of the variation in the data) do not necessarily capture most of the cluster structure. We also showed that clustering with {PCs} has different impact on different algorithms and different similarity metrics. Overall, we would not recommend {PCA} before clustering except in special circumstances.},

	abstract = {Purpose Alzheimer’s disease ({AD)} is the most common form of dementia. Clinically, it is characterized by progressive cognitive and functional impairment with structural hallmarks of cortical atrophy and ventricular expansion. Amyloid plaque aggregation is also known to occur in {AD} subjects. In-vivo imaging of amyloid plaques is now possible with positron emission tomography ({PET)} radioligands. {PET} imaging suffers from a degrading phenomenon known as the partial volume effect ({PVE).} The quantitative accuracy of {PET} images is reduced by {PVEs} primarily due to the limited spatial resolution of the scanner. The degree of {PVE} is influenced by structure size, with smaller structures tending to suffer from more severe {PVEs} such as atrophied grey matter regions. The aims of this paper were to investigate the effect of partial volume correction ({PVC)} on the quantification of amyloid {PET} and to highlight the importance of selecting an appropriate {PVC} technique. Methods An improved {PVC} technique, region-based voxel-wise ({RBV)} correction, was compared against existing Van-Cittert ({VC)} and Müller-Gärtner ({MG)} methods using amyloid {PET} imaging data. Digital phantom data were produced using segmented {MRI} scans from a control subject and an {AD} subject. Typical tracer distributions were generated for each of the phantom anatomies. Also examined were 70 clinical {PET} scans acquired using [{18F]flutemetamol.} Volume of interest ({VOI)} analysis was performed for corrected and uncorrected images. Results {PVC} was shown to improve the quantitative accuracy of regional analysis performed on amyloid {PET} images. Of the corrections applied, {VC} deconvolution demonstrated the worst recovery of grey matter values. {MG} {PVC} was shown to induce biases in some grey matter regions due to grey matter variability. In addition, white matter variability was shown to influence the accuracy of {MG} {PVC} in cortical grey matter and also cerebellar grey matter, a typical reference region for amyloid {PET} normalization in sporadic {AD.} {RBV} was shown to be more accurate than {MG} in terms of grey matter and white matter uptake. An increase in within-group variability after {PVC} was observed and is believed to be a genuine, more accurate representation of the data rather than a correction-induced error. The standardized uptake value ratio ({SUVR)} threshold for classifying subjects as either amyloid-positive or amyloid-negative was found to be 1.64 in the uncorrected dataset, rising to 2.25 after {PVC.} Conclusion Care should be taken when applying {PVC} to amyloid {PET} images. Assumptions made in existing {PVC} strategies can induce biases that could lead to erroneous inferences about uptake in certain regions. The proposed {RBV} {PVC} technique accounts for within-compartment variability, with the potential to reduce errors of this kind.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the model problem of reconstructing an object from incomplete frequency samples. Consider a discrete-time signal f ∈ {CN} and a randomly chosen set of frequencies Ω. It is possible to reconstruct f from the partial knowledge of its Fourier coefficients on the set Ω? A typical result of this paper is as follows. Suppose that f is a superposition of T spikes f(t) = {∑τ∈T} f(τ)δ(t-τ) obeying T ≤ {CM} · (log N)-1 · Ω for some constant {CM} \&gt; 0. We do not know the locations of the spikes nor their amplitudes. Then with probability at least 1 - O(N-M, f can be reconstructed exactly as the solution to the ℓ1 minimization problem {ming∑t=oN-1} g(t) , s.t.ĝ(ω) = f̂(ω) for all ω ∈ Ω. In short, exact recovery may be obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. We give numerical values for {CM} which depend on the desired probability of success. Our result may be interpreted as a novel kind of nonlinear sampling theorem. In effect, it says that any signal made out of T spikes may be recovered by convex programming from almost every set of frequencies of size O( T · log N). Moreover, this is nearly optimal in the sense that any method succeeding with probability 1 - O(N-M) would in general require a number of frequency samples at least proportional to T · log N. The methodology extends to a variety of other situations and higher dimensions. For example, we show how one can reconstruct a piecewise constant (one- or two-dimensional) object from incomplete frequency samples - provided that the number of jumps (discontinuities) obeys the condition above - by minimizing other convex functionals such as the total variation of f. © 2006 {IEEE.}},

An individual network is established for each subject using the mean cortical thickness of cortical regions as defined by the {AAL} atlas. Specifically, for each subject, we compute a similarity matrix of mean cortical thickness between pairs of cortical regions, which we refer to hereafter as the individual’s network. Such individual networks can be used for classification. We use a combination of two types of feature selection approaches to search for the most discriminative edges. These edges serve as the input to a support vector machine ({SVM)} for classification. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed method by a comparison with classifying the raw cortical thickness data, and individual networks, using a publically available dataset. In particular, 83 subjects from the {OASIS} database were chosen to validate this approach, 39 of which were diagnosed with either mild cognitive impairment ({MCI)} or moderate Alzheimer’s disease ({AD)} and the remaining were age-matched controls. While using an {SVM} on the raw cortical thickness data or individual networks without hybrid feature selection resulted in less than or nearly 80\% classification accuracy, our approach yielded 90.4\% classification accuracy in leave-one-out analysis.},

The aim of this work was to investigate the clinical feasibility and accuracy of {PVE} correction methods based on Recovery Coefficients ({RC)} as function of measured Lesion-to-Background ratio ({L/B)m} and measured lesion volume (Vm). {PET-CT} measurements were performed. The radioactivity concentration (Cm) and Vm were measured from images using Operator-Dependent and Operator-Independent ({OI)} techniques. {RC} curves were obtained combining {RC} from {NEMA} 2001 {IQ} phantom measurements as function of Sphere-to-Background ratio ({S/B)m} and sphere Vm. {PVE} correction was applied to {PET-CT} studies of anthropomorphic oncological phantoms and to {PET-CT} oncological studies (basal and follow up). The underestimation of Cm due to {PVE} in the {NEMA} {IQ} spheres (up to 80\%) confirmed the severity of the error. The more feasible (always applicable, noise insensitive, reproducible) way to measure radioactivity was found by the use of an {OI} threshold technique. Our results showed that this measurement technique allows to achieve a {PVE} correction accuracy {\textgreater}; 87\% (error in radioactivity estimate {\textless}; 13\%) for a sphere diameter {\textgreater}; 1 cm. In patient studies the {PVE} correction was found to modify both {SUV} and {SUV} variations during patient follow up and our analysis showed that a {PVE} corrected {SUV} quantification increases the diagnostic confidence of oncological {PET-CT} studies.},

	abstract = {How rich functionality emerges from the invariant structural architecture of the brain remains a major mystery in neuroscience. Recent applications of network theory and theoretical neuroscience to large-scale brain networks have started to dissolve this mystery. Network analyses suggest that hierarchical modular brain networks are particularly suited to facilitate local (segregated) neuronal operations and the global integration of segregated functions. Although functional networks are constrained by structural connections, context-sensitive integration during cognition tasks necessarily entails a divergence between structural and functional networks. This degenerate (many-to-one) function-structure mapping is crucial for understanding the nature of brain networks. The emergence of dynamic functional networks from static structural connections calls for a formal (computational) approach to neuronal information processing that may resolve this dialectic between structure and function.
Background The human brain presents a puzzling and challenging paradox: Despite a fixed anatomy, characterized by its connectivity, its functional repertoire is vast, enabling action, perception, and cognition. This contrasts with organs like the heart that have a dynamic anatomy but just one function. The resolution of this paradox may reside in the brain's network architecture, which organizes local interactions to cope with diverse environmental demands—ensuring adaptability, robustness, resilience to damage, efficient message passing, and diverse functionality from a fixed structure. This review asks how recent advances in understanding brain networks elucidate the brain’s many-to-one (degenerate) function-structure relationships. In other words, how does diverse function arise from an apparently static neuronal architecture? We conclude that the emergence of dynamic functional connectivity, from static structural connections, calls for formal (computational) approaches to neuronal information processing that may resolve the dialectic between structure and function.
Schematic of the multiscale hierarchical organization of brain networks. Brain function or cognition can be described as the global integration of local (segregated) neuronal operations that underlies hierarchical message passing among cortical areas, and which is facilitated by hierarchical modular network architectures.
Advances Much of our understanding of brain connectivity rests on the way that it is measured and modeled. We consider two complementary approaches: the first has its basis in graph theory that aims to describe the network topology of (undirected) connections of the sort measured by noninvasive brain imaging of anatomical connections and functional connectivity (correlations) between remote sites. This is compared with model-based definitions of context-sensitive (directed) effective connectivity that are grounded in the biophysics of neuronal interactions. Recent topological network analyses of brain circuits suggest that modular and hierarchical structural networks are particularly suited for the functional integration of local (functionally specialized) neuronal operations that underlie cognition. Measurements of spontaneous activity reveal functional connectivity patterns that are similar to structural connectivity, suggesting that structural networks constrain functional networks. However, task-related responses that require context-sensitive integration disclose a divergence between function and structure that appears to rest mainly on long-range connections. In contrast to methods that describe network topology phenomenologically, model-based theoretical and computational approaches focus on the mechanisms of neuronal interactions that accommodate the dynamic reconfiguration of effective connectivity. We highlight the consilience between hierarchical topologies (based on structural and functional connectivity) and the effective connectivity that would be required for hierarchical message passing of the sort suggested by computational neuroscience.
Outlook In summary, neuronal interactions represent dynamics on a fixed structural connectivity that underlie cognition and behavior. Such divergence of function from structure is, perhaps, the most intriguing property of the brain and invites intensive future research. By studying the dynamics and self-organization of functional networks, we may gain insight into the true nature of the brain as the embodiment of the mind. The repertoire of functional networks rests upon the (hidden) structural architecture of connections that enables hierarchical functional integration. Understanding these networks will require theoretical models of neuronal processing that underlies cognition.},

	abstract = {Voxel-based morphometry ({VBM)} studies have interpreted longitudinal medication- or behaviorally induced changes observed on T1-weighted magnetic resonance images ({MRIs)} as changes in neuronal structure. Although neurogenesis or atrophy certainly occurs, the use of T1-weighted scans to identify change in brain structure in vivo in humans has vulnerability: the T1 relaxation time for arterial blood and gray matter are not clearly distinguishable and therefore, apparent reported structural findings might be at least partially related to changes in blood flow or other physiological signals. To examine the hypothesis that apparent structural modifications may reflect changes introduced by additional mechanisms irrespective of potential neuronal growth/atrophy, we acquired a high-resolution T1-weighted structural scan and a 5-min perfusion {fMRI} scan (a measurement of blood flow), before and after administration of an acute pharmacological manipulation. In a within-subject design, 15 subjects were either un-medicated or were administered a 20 mg dose of baclofen (an {FDA-approved} anti-spastic) approximately 110 min before acquiring a T1-weighted scan and a pseudo continuous arterial spin labeled perfusion {fMRI} scan. Using diffeomorphic anatomical registration through exponentiated lie algebra within {SPM7}, we observed macroscopic, and therefore implausible, baclofen-induced decreases in {VBM} ‘gray matter’ signal in the dorsal rostral anterior cingulate (family wise error corrected at p {\textless} 0.04, T = 6.54, extent: 1,460 voxels) that overlapped with changes in blood flow. Given that gray matter reductions are unlikely following a single dose of medication these findings suggest that changes in blood flow are masquerading as reductions in gray matter on the T1-weighted scan irrespective of the temporal interval between baseline measures and longitudinal manipulations. These results underscore the crucial and immediate need to develop in vivo neuroimaging biomarkers for humans that can uniquely capture changes in neuronal structure dissociable from those related to blood flow or other physiological signals.},

	abstract = {We consider a linear regression problem in a high dimensional setting where the number of covariates p can be much larger than the sam- ple size n. In such a situation, one often assumes sparsity of the regression vector, i.e., the regression vector contains many zero components. We pro- pose a Lasso-type estimator β 
                        Quad (where {'Quad'} stands for quadratic) which is based on two penalty terms. The first one is the ℓ 
                        1 norm of the re- gression coefficients used to exploit the sparsity of the regression as done by the Lasso estimator, whereas the second is a quadratic penalty term intro- duced to capture some additional information on the setting of the problem. We detail two special cases: the Elastic-Net β 
                        {EN} introduced in. [42], which deals with sparse problems where correlations between variables may exist; and the Smooth-Lasso† β 
                        {SL}, which responds to sparse problems where successive regression coefficients are known to vary slowly (in some situations, this can also be interpreted in terms of correlations between successive variables). From a theoretical point of view, we establish variable selection consistency results and show that {βQuad} achieves a Sparsity Inequality, i.e., a bound in terms of the number of non-zero components of the 'true' regression vector. These results are provided under a weaker assumption on the Gram matrix than the one used by the Lasso. In some situations this guarantees a significant improvement over the Lasso. Furthermore, a simulation study is conducted and shows that the S-Lasso β 
                        {SL} performs better than known methods as the Lasso, the Elastic-Net β 
                        {EN}, and the Fused-Lasso (introduced in. [30]) with respect to the estimation accuracy. This is especially the case when the regression vector is 'smooth', i.e., when the variations between successive coefficients of the unknown parameter of the regression are small. The study also reveals that the theoretical calibration of the tuning parameters and the one based on 10 fold cross validation imply two S-Lasso solutions with close performance.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} The discovery of genetic associations is an important factor in the understanding of human illness to derive disease pathways. Identifying multiple interacting genetic mutations associated with disease remains challenging in studying the etiology of complex diseases. And although recently new single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs)} at genes implicated in immune response, cholesterol/lipid metabolism, and cell membrane processes have been confirmed by genome-wide association studies ({GWAS)} to be associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease ({LOAD)}, a percentage of {AD} heritability continues to be unexplained. We try to find other genetic variants that may influence {LOAD} risk utilizing data mining methods.
{METHODS:} Two different approaches were devised to select {SNPs} associated with {LOAD} in a publicly available {GWAS} data set consisting of three cohorts. In both approaches, single-locus analysis (logistic regression) was conducted to filter the data with a less conservative p-value than the Bonferroni threshold; this resulted in a subset of {SNPs} used next in multi-locus analysis (random forest ({RF)).} In the second approach, we took into account prior biological knowledge, and performed sample stratification and linkage disequilibrium ({LD)} in addition to logistic regression analysis to preselect loci to input into the {RF} classifier construction step.
{RESULTS:} The first approach gave 199 {SNPs} mostly associated with genes in calcium signaling, cell adhesion, endocytosis, immune response, and synaptic function. These {SNPs} together with {APOE} and {GAB2} {SNPs} formed a predictive subset for {LOAD} status with an average error of 9.8\% using 10-fold cross validation ({CV)} in {RF} modeling. Nineteen variants in {LD} with {ST5}, {TRPC1}, {ATG10}, {ANO3}, {NDUFA12}, and {NISCH} respectively, genes linked directly or indirectly with neurobiology, were identified with the second approach. These variants were part of a model that included {APOE} and {GAB2} {SNPs} to predict {LOAD} risk which produced a 10-fold {CV} average error of 17.5\% in the classification modeling.
{CONCLUSIONS:} With the two proposed approaches, we identified a large subset of {SNPs} in genes mostly clustered around specific pathways/functions and a smaller set of {SNPs}, within or in proximity to five genes not previously reported, that may be relevant for the prediction/understanding of {AD.}},

Using a unique longitudinal data set including ecologically valid in-home measures of early experience during childhood (at age 4 and 8 years) and high-resolution structural brain imaging during adolescence (mean age 14 years), we examined the effects on later brain morphology of two dimensions of early experience: parental nurturance and environmental stimulation. Parental nurturance at age 4 predicts the volume of the left hippocampus in adolescence, with better nurturance associated with smaller hippocampal volume. In contrast, environmental stimulation did not correlate with hippocampal volume. Moreover, the association between hippocampal volume and parental nurturance disappears at age 8, supporting the existence of a sensitive developmental period for brain maturation. These findings indicate that variation in normal childhood experience is associated with differences in brain morphology, and hippocampal volume is specifically associated with early parental nurturance. Our results provide neuroimaging evidence supporting the important role of warm parental care during early childhood for brain maturation.},

While the initial formulations involve nonconvex functions, and are therefore computationally intractable, we rewrite them into the form of an optimization program involving maximization of a convex function on a compact set. The dimension of the search space is decreased enormously if the data matrix has many more columns (variables) than rows. We then propose and analyze a simple gradient method suited for the task. It appears that our algorithm has best convergence properties in the case when either the objective function or the feasible set are strongly convex, which is the case with our single-unit formulations and can be enforced in the block case. Finally, we demonstrate numerically on a set of random and gene expression test problems that our approach outperforms existing algorithms both in quality of the obtained solution and in computational speed. \&copy; 2010 Michel Journée, Yurii Nesterov, Peter Richtárik and Rodolphe Sepulchre.},

	abstract = {John Ashburner and Karl Friston (2000) introduced a standardized method of “voxel-based morphometry” ({VBM)} for comparisons of local concentrations of gray matter between two groups of subjects. Segmented images of gray matter from grossly normalized high-resolution images are smoothed and their group differences analyzed by the now-conventional voxelwise Worsley approach to Gaussian random fields of differences. This comment concerns an unfortunate interaction between the algorithm's spatial normalization and voxelwise comparison steps, whereby several obvious quantitative confounds are injected at the core of the inference engine the authors put forward. Specifically, the statistics of the resulting voxelwise comparisons are uninformative about group differences wherever the spatial normalization algorithm has failed to register on any robustly appearing image gradient. The method of Ashburner and Friston is defensible only far from all image gradients.},

The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as "eigenfaces," because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture.},

We approximate the matrix X as {circumflexX} = sigma(k=1)(K) d(k)u(k)v(k)(T), where d(k), u(k), and v(k) minimize the squared Frobenius norm of X - {circumflexX}, subject to penalties on u(k) and v(k). This results in a regularized version of the singular value decomposition. Of particular interest is the use of L(1)-penalties on u(k) and v(k), which yields a decomposition of X using sparse vectors. We show that when the {PMD} is applied using an L(1)-penalty on v(k) but not on u(k), a method for sparse principal components results. In fact, this yields an efficient algorithm for the {"SCoTLASS"} proposal (Jolliffe and others 2003) for obtaining sparse principal components. This method is demonstrated on a publicly available gene expression data set. We also establish connections between the {SCoTLASS} method for sparse principal component analysis and the method of Zou and others (2006). In addition, we show that when the {PMD} is applied to a cross-products matrix, it results in a method for penalized canonical correlation analysis ({CCA).} We apply this penalized {CCA} method to simulated data and to a genomic data set consisting of gene expression and {DNA} copy number measurements on the same set of samples.},

Three types of anti-{mRNA} strategies can be distinguished. Firstly, the use of single stranded antisense-oligonucleotides; secondly, the triggering of {RNA} cleavage through catalytically active oligonucleotides referred to as ribozymes; and thirdly, {RNA} interference induced by small interfering {RNA} molecules. Despite the seemingly simple idea to reduce translation by oligonucleotides complementary to an {mRNA}, several problems have to be overcome for successful application. Accessible sites of the target {RNA} for oligonucleotide binding have to be identified, antisense agents have to be protected against nucleolytic attack, and their cellular uptake and correct intracellular localization have to be achieved. Major disadvantages of commonly used phosphorothioate {DNA} oligonucleotides are their low affinity towards target {RNA} molecules and their toxic side-effects. Some of these problems have been solved in ‘second generation’ nucleotides with alkyl modifications at the 2′ position of the ribose. In recent years valuable progress has been achieved through the development of novel chemically modified nucleotides with improved properties such as enhanced serum stability, higher target affinity and low toxicity. In addition, {RNA-cleaving} ribozymes and deoxyribozymes, and the use of 21-mer double-stranded {RNA} molecules for {RNA} interference applications in mammalian cells offer highly efficient strategies to suppress the expression of a specific gene.},

	abstract = {Background: Bapineuzumab, a humanized anti-amyloid-beta (Aβ) monoclonal antibody for the potential treatment of Alzheimer disease ({AD)}, was evaluated in a multiple ascending dose, safety, and efficacy study in mild to moderate {AD.}
Methods: The study enrolled 234 patients, randomly assigned to {IV} bapineuzumab or placebo in 4 dose cohorts (0.15, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg/kg). Patients received 6 infusions, 13 weeks apart, with final assessments at week 78. The prespecified primary efficacy analysis in the modified intent-to-treat population assumed linear decline and compared treatment differences within dose cohorts on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment {Scale–Cognitive} and Disability Assessment for Dementia. Exploratory analyses combined dose cohorts and did not assume a specific pattern of decline.
Results: No significant differences were found in the primary efficacy analysis. Exploratory analyses showed potential treatment differences (p {\textless} 0.05, unadjusted for multiple comparisons) on cognitive and functional endpoints in study “completers” and {APOE} ε4 noncarriers. Reversible vasogenic edema, detected on brain {MRI} in 12/124 (9.7\%) bapineuzumab-treated patients, was more frequent in higher dose groups and {APOE} ε4 carriers. Six vasogenic edema patients were asymptomatic; 6 experienced transient symptoms.
Conclusions: Primary efficacy outcomes in this phase 2 trial were not significant. Potential treatment differences in the exploratory analyses support further investigation of bapineuzumab in phase 3 with special attention to {APOE} ε4 carrier status.
Classification of evidence: Due to varying doses and a lack of statistical precision, this Class {II} ascending dose trial provides insufficient evidence to support or refute a benefit of bapineuzumab.},

	abstract = {We develop a face recognition algorithm which is insensitive to large variation in lighting direction and facial expression. Taking a pattern classification approach, we consider each pixel in an image as a coordinate in a high-dimensional space. We take advantage of the observation that the images of a particular face, under varying illumination but fixed pose, lie in a {3D} linear subspace of the high dimensional image space-if the face is a Lambertian surface without shadowing. However, since faces are not truly Lambertian surfaces and do indeed produce self-shadowing, images will deviate from this linear subspace. Rather than explicitly modeling this deviation, we linearly project the image into a subspace in a manner which discounts those regions of the face with large deviation. Our projection method is based on Fisher's Linear Discriminant and produces well separated classes in a low-dimensional subspace, even under severe variation in lighting and facial expressions. The Eigenface technique, another method based on linearly projecting the image space to a low dimensional subspace, has similar computational requirements. Yet, extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed {"Fisherface"} method has error rates that are lower than those of the Eigenface technique for tests on the Harvard and Yale Face Databases. ©1997 {IEEE.}},

We apply the {SCCA} model to a dataset that includes 23 control subjects that are demographically matched to 49 subjects with autopsy or {CSF-biomarker-diagnosed} {AD} (n=24) and {FTD} (n=25) with both {DTI} and T1-weighted structural imaging. {SCCA} shows that the {FTD-related} frontal and temporal degeneration pattern is correlated across modalities with permutation corrected p{\textless}0.0005. In {AD}, we find significant association between cortical thinning and reduction in white matter integrity within a distributed parietal and temporal network (p{\textless}0.0005). Furthermore, we show that-within {SCCA} identified regions-significant differences exist between {FTD} and {AD} cortical-connective degeneration patterns. We validate these distinct, multimodal imaging patterns by showing unique relationships with cognitive measures in {AD} and {FTD.} We conclude that {SCCA} is a potentially valuable approach in image analysis that can be applied productively to distinguishing between neurodegenerative conditions.},

Head linear acceleration was measured over a 10-h period in 20 subjects during the course of a day, which encompassed a broad range of locomotor (walking, running, cycling) and nonlocomotor (working at a desk, driving a car, riding a bus or subway) activities. Here we show a highly tuned resonant frequency of human locomotion at 2 Hz ({SD} 0.13) with no evidence of correlation with gender, age, height, weight, or body mass index. This frequency did not differ significantly from the preferred step frequency observed in the seminal laboratory study of Murray et al. (Murray {MP}, Drought {AB}, and Kory {RC.} J Bone Joint Surg {46A:} 335-360, 1964). [1.95 Hz ({SD} 0.19)]. On the basis of the frequency characteristics of otolith-spinal reflexes, which drive lower body movement via the lateral vestibulospinal tract, and otolith-mediated collic and ocular reflexes that maintain gaze when walking, we speculate that this spontaneous tempo of locomotion represents some form of central "resonant frequency" of human movement.},

	abstract = {Shrinkage is a well known and appealing denoising technique, introduced originally by Donoho and Johnstone in 1994. The use of shrinkage for denoising is known to be optimal for Gaussian white noise, provided that the sparsity on the signal's representation is enforced using a unitary transform. Still, shrinkage is also practiced with nonunitary, and even redundant representations, typically leading to very satisfactory results. In this correspondence we shed some light on this behavior. The main argument in this work is that such simple shrinkage could be interpreted as the first iteration of an algorithm that solves the basis pursuit denoising ({BPDN)} problem. While the desired solution of {BPDN} is hard to obtain in general, we develop a simple iterative procedure for the {BPDN} minimization that amounts to stepwise shrinkage. We demonstrate how the simple shrinkage emerges as the first iteration of this novel algorithm. Furthermore, we show how shrinkage can be iterated, turning into an effective algorithm that minimizes the {BPDN} via simple shrinkage steps, in order to further strengthen the denoising effect},

Forty-eight mild cognitive impairment subjects received structural and {ASL-MRI} scans at baseline and clinical and neuropsychologic assessments annually. Thirteen subjects became demented during the period of longitudinal observation (2.7 ± 1.0 y). Cox regression analyses suggest that baseline hippocampal volume [relative risk ({RR)} = 0.99, P = 0.004], baseline right inferior parietal ({RR} = 0.64, P = 0.01) and right middle frontal ({RR} = 0.73, P = 0.01) perfusion were associated with conversion to dementia. Results from linear mixed effects modeling suggest that baseline perfusion from the right precuneus predicted subsequent declines in Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (P = 0.002), Functional Activates Questionnaire (P = 0.01), and selective attention (ie, Stroop switching, P = 0.009) whereas baseline perfusion from the right middle frontal cortex predicted subsequent episodic memory decline (ie, total recognition discriminability score from the California Verbal Learning Test, P = 0.03). These results suggest that hypoperfusion as detected by {ASL-MRI} can predict subsequent clinical, functional, and cognitive decline and may be useful for identifying candidates for future Alzheimer disease treatment trials.},

Among the brain regions implicated in this network, several, including the posterior cingulate cortex and inferior parietal lobes, have also shown decreased metabolism early in the course of Alzheimer's disease ({AD).} We reasoned that default-mode network activity might therefore be abnormal in {AD.} To test this hypothesis, we used independent component analysis to isolate the network in a group of 13 subjects with mild {AD} and in a group of 13 age-matched elderly controls as they performed a simple sensory-motor processing task. Three important findings are reported. Prominent coactivation of the hippocampus, detected in all groups, suggests that the default-mode network is closely involved with episodic memory processing. The {AD} group showed decreased resting-state activity in the posterior cingulate and hippocampus, suggesting that disrupted connectivity between these two regions accounts for the posterior cingulate hypometabolism commonly detected in positron emission tomography studies of early {AD.} Finally, a goodness-of-fit analysis applied at the individual subject level suggests that activity in the default-mode network may ultimately prove a sensitive and specific biomarker for incipient {AD.}},

Here a new {PV} correction method for multi-inversion time {ASL} is proposed that exploits {PV} estimates within a spatially regularized kinetic curve model analysis. The proposed method exploits both {PV} estimates and the different kinetics of the {ASL} signal arising from {GM} and white matter. The new correction method is shown, on both simulated and real data, to provide correction of {GM} {CBF} comparable to a linear regression approach, whilst preserving greater spatial detail in the {CBF} image. On real data corrected {GM} {CBF} values were found to be largely independent of {GM} {PV}, implying that the correction had been successful.

We compare two voxelwise approaches: (1) fitting multiple univariate models, one for each outcome and then adjusting for multiple comparisons among the outcomes and (2) fitting a multivariate model. In both cases, adjustment for multiple comparisons is performed over all voxels jointly to account for the search over the brain. The multivariate model is able to account for the multiple comparisons over outcomes without assuming independence because the covariance structure between modalities is estimated. Simulations show that the multivariate approach is more powerful when the outcomes are correlated and, even when the outcomes are independent, the multivariate approach is just as powerful or more powerful when at least two outcomes are dependent on predictors in the model. However, multiple univariate regressions with Bonferroni correction remain a desirable alternative in some circumstances. To illustrate the power of each approach, we analyze a case control study of Alzheimer's disease, in which data from three {MRI} modalities are available.

Apart from gender and age, information such as genotype or a derived biomarker is often available in clinical studies and can inform the classification of a query subject. Such information, whether discrete or continuous, is used as an additional input to manifold learning, extending the Laplacian Eigenmap objective function and enriching a similarity measure derived from pairwise image similarities. The biomarkers identified with the proposed method are data-driven in contrast to a priori defined biomarkers derived from, e.g., manual or automated segmentations.

	abstract = {Abstract 
Multivariate machine learning methods are increasingly used to analyze neuroimaging data, often replacing more traditional “mass univariate” techniques that fit data one voxel at a time. In the functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI)} literature, this has led to broad application of “off-the-shelf” classification and regression methods. These generic approaches allow investigators to use ready-made algorithms to accurately decode perceptual, cognitive, or behavioral states from distributed patterns of neural activity. However, when applied to correlated whole-brain {fMRI} data these methods suffer from coefficient instability, are sensitive to outliers, and yield dense solutions that are hard to interpret without arbitrary thresholding. Here, we develop variants of the Graph-constrained Elastic-Net ({GraphNet)}, a fast, whole-brain regression and classification method developed for spatially and temporally correlated data that automatically yields interpretable coefficient maps (Grosenick et al., 2009b). {GraphNet} methods yield sparse but structured solutions by combining structured graph constraints (based on knowledge about coefficient smoothness or connectivity) with a global sparsity-inducing prior that automatically selects important variables. Because {GraphNet} methods can efficiently fit regression or classification models to whole-brain, multiple time-point data sets and enhance classification accuracy relative to volume-of-interest ({VOI)} approaches, they eliminate the need for inherently biased {VOI} analyses and allow whole-brain fitting without the multiple comparison problems that plague mass univariate and roaming {VOI} (“searchlight”) methods. As {fMRI} data are unlikely to be normally distributed, we (1) extend {GraphNet} to include robust loss functions that confer insensitivity to outliers, (2) equip them with “adaptive” penalties that asymptotically guarantee correct variable selection, and (3) develop a novel sparse structured Support Vector {GraphNet} classifier ({SVGN).} When applied to previously published data (Knutson et al., 2007), these efficient whole-brain methods significantly improved classification accuracy over previously reported {VOI-based} analyses on the same data (Grosenick et al., 2008; Knutson et al., 2007) while discovering task-related regions not documented in the original {VOI} approach. Critically, {GraphNet} estimates fit to the Knutson et al. (2007) data generalize well to out-of-sample data collected more than three years later on the same task but with different subjects and stimuli (Karmarkar et al., submitted for publication). By enabling robust and efficient selection of important voxels from whole-brain data taken over multiple time points (\&gt; 100,000 “features”), these methods enable data-driven selection of brain areas that accurately predict single-trial behavior within and across individuals.},

We observed that in the ileum of {IBD} patients, {mRNA} levels for serotonin transporter, equilibrative nucleoside transporter ({ENT)} 1, {ENT2}, and organic anion-transporting polypeptide ({OATP)} {2B1} were significantly elevated, whereas levels for apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter ({ASBT)} and organic zwitterion/cation transporter ({OCTN)} 2 were significantly lower. In colon, {mRNA} levels for {ENT1}, {ENT2}, concentrative nucleoside transporter ({CNT)} 2, {OATP2B1}, and {OATP4A1} were significantly higher, whereas {mRNA} levels for {OCTN2} were significantly decreased. In inflamed colon of {IBD} patients the {mRNA} expression levels of {ENT1}, {ENT2}, {CNT2}, {OATP2B1}, {OATP4A1}, and peptide transporter 1 were significantly higher. We conclude that intestinal {SLC} {mRNA} levels are dysregulated in {IBD} patients, which may be linked to the inflammation of the tissue and provides an indication about the role of inflammatory signaling in regulation of {SLC} expression.},

Despite significant advances in multimodal imaging techniques and analysis approaches, unimodal studies are still the predominant way to investigate brain changes or group differences, including structural magnetic resonance imaging ({sMRI)}, functional {MRI} ({fMRI)}, diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI)} and electroencephalography ({EEG).} Multimodal brain studies can be used to understand the complex interplay of anatomical, functional and physiological brain alterations or development, and to better comprehend the biological significance of multiple imaging measures. To examine the function–structure associations of the brain in a more comprehensive and integrated manner, we reviewed a number of multimodal studies that combined two or more functional ({fMRI} and/or {EEG)} and structural ({sMRI} and/or {DTI)} modalities. In this review paper, we specifically focused on multimodal neuroimaging studies on cognition, aging, disease and behavior. We also compared multiple analysis approaches, including univariate and multivariate methods. The possible strengths and limitations of each method are highlighted, which can guide readers when selecting a method based on a given research question. In particular, we believe that multimodal fusion approaches will shed further light on the neuronal mechanisms underlying the major structural and functional pathophysiological features of both the healthy brain (e.g. development) or the diseased brain (e.g. mental illness) and, in the latter case, may provide a more sensitive measure than unimodal imaging for disease classification, e.g. multimodal biomarkers, which potentially can be used to support clinical diagnosis based on neuroimaging techniques.},

	abstract = {Aim
To compare the diagnostic utility of pelvic ultrasound ({US)} and magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} on the clinical decision to proceed with uterine artery embolization ({UAE).}
Materials and methods
Over 2 years, 180 consecutive women (mean age 43) sought consultation for {UAE}, 116 underwent pelvic {US} and {MRI} before possible {UAE.} {US} was performed prior to {MRI.} Imaging was analysed for leiomyoma quantity, size and location, uterine volume, and the presence of potential contraindications to {UAE.} Discrepancies between imaging methods and cases where discrepancies could have altered management, were recorded.
Results
For the 116 patients who completed imaging, the average uterine volume was 701\&\#xa0;cm3 using {MRI} versus 658\&\#xa0;cm3 using {US} (p\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;0.48). The average dominant leiomyoma volume was 292\&\#xa0;cm3 using {MRI} versus 253\&\#xa0;cm3 using {US} (p\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;0.16). In 14 (12.1\%) patients {US} did not correctly quantify or localize leiomyomas compared with {MRI} (p\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;0.0005). Thirteen patients did not undergo {UAE} (patient preference n\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;9, pre-procedural imaging findings n\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;4). In the four cases where {UAE} was not performed due to imaging findings, relevant findings were all diagnosed by {MRI} compared with two by {US} (p\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;0.5). The two cases not detected by ultrasound were adenomyosis and a pedunculate subserosal leiomyoma. Of the 103 patients who underwent {UAE}, 14 were treated (without complication) despite the presence of a relative contraindication; all 14 relative contraindications were identified by {MRI} compared with 13 by {US} (p\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;1.0).
Conclusion
{MRI} is more accurate than {US} for characterizing uterine leiomyomas. In a small but statistically insignificant number of cases, {MRI} identified findings that were missed by {US}, which changed management. For patients that are unsuitable to be assessed with {MRI}, ultrasound alone is sufficient for pre-{UAE} assessment.},

	abstract = {Abstract
The increase in spatiotemporal resolution of neuroimaging devices is accompanied by a trend towards more powerful multivariate analysis methods. Often it is desired to interpret the outcome of these methods with respect to the cognitive processes under study. Here we discuss which methods allow for such interpretations, and provide guidelines for choosing an appropriate analysis for a given experimental goal: For a surgeon who needs to decide where to remove brain tissue it is most important to determine the origin of cognitive functions and associated neural processes. In contrast, when communicating with paralyzed or comatose patients via brain–computer interfaces, it is most important to accurately extract the neural processes specific to a certain mental state. These equally important but complementary objectives require different analysis methods. Determining the origin of neural processes in time or space from the parameters of a data-driven model requires what we call a forward model of the data; such a model explains how the measured data was generated from the neural sources. Examples are general linear models ({GLMs).} Methods for the extraction of neural information from data can be considered as backward models, as they attempt to reverse the data generating process. Examples are multivariate classifiers. Here we demonstrate that the parameters of forward models are neurophysiologically interpretable in the sense that significant nonzero weights are only observed at channels the activity of which is related to the brain process under study. In contrast, the interpretation of backward model parameters can lead to wrong conclusions regarding the spatial or temporal origin of the neural signals of interest, since significant nonzero weights may also be observed at channels the activity of which is statistically independent of the brain process under study. As a remedy for the linear case, we propose a procedure for transforming backward models into forward models. This procedure enables the neurophysiological interpretation of the parameters of linear backward models. We hope that this work raises awareness for an often encountered problem and provides a theoretical basis for conducting better interpretable multivariate neuroimaging analyses.},

A second level of larger and more invariant features is obtained by training the same algorithm on patches of features from the first level. Training a supervised classifier on these features yields 0.64\% error on {MNIST}, and 54\% average recognition rate on Caltech 101 with 30 training samples per category. While the resulting architecture is similar to convolutional networks, the layer-wise unsupervised training procedure alleviates the over-parameterization problems that plague purely supervised learning procedures, and yields good performance with very few labeled training samples.},

The effects of demographic factors on cortical thickness were analyzed by applying linear regression after controlling confounding factors. Older individuals in {NCI} group showed more cortical thinning in frontal, temporal association cortices and insula than younger participants. Early onset {AD} was associated with cortical thinning in the parietal lobe, whereas late onset {AD} was associated with cortical thinning in the medial temporal region. The {NCI} group demonstrated sex-related differences in cortical thickness, although those differences were not present in the {AD} group. While the education effect was absent in {NCI} individuals, high levels of education in the {AD} group correlated with cortical thinning in the frontal and temporoparietal association cortices. Our results show that {AD} with earlier onset and higher education had suffered more pronounced cortical atrophy in specific parts of the brain than their counterparts, which may be related to cognitive reserve theory.},

	abstract = {Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging allows researchers and clinicians to identify individual white matter fiber tracts and map their trajectories. The reliability and interpretability of fiber-tracking procedures is improved when a priori anatomical information is used as a guide. We have developed an automated method for labeling white matter fiber tracts in individual subjects based on a probabilistic atlas of fiber tract locations and orientations. The probabilistic fiber atlas contains 23 fiber tracts and was constructed by manually identifying fiber tracts in 21 healthy controls and 21 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy ({TLE).} The manual tract identification method required ∼40 h of manual editing by a trained image analyst using multiple regions of interest to select or exclude streamline fibers. Identification of fiber tracts with the atlas does not require human intervention, but nonetheless benefits from the a priori anatomical information that was used to manually identify the tracts included in the atlas. We applied this method to compare fractional anisotropy—thought to be a measure of white matter integrity—in individual fiber tracts between control subjects and patients with {TLE.} We found that the atlas-based and manual fiber selection methods produced a similar pattern of results. However, the between-group effect sizes using the atlas-derived fibers were generally as large or larger than those obtained with manually selected fiber tracks.

The key component of the proposed algorithm is a novel {DT} image registration method that leverages metrics comparing tensors as a whole and optimizes tensor orientation explicitly. The problem of unbiased atlas construction is formulated using the approach proposed by Joshi et al., i.e., the unbiased {WM} atlas is determined by finding the mappings that best match the atlas to the images in the population and have the least amount of deformation. We show how the proposed registration algorithm can be adapted to approximately find the optimal atlas. The utility of the proposed approach is demonstrated by constructing a {WM} atlas of 13 subjects. The presented {DT} registration method is also compared to the approach of matching {DT} images by aligning their fractional anisotropy images using large-deformation image registration methods. Our results suggest that using full tensor information can better align the orientations of {WM} fiber bundles.},

An adaptive mean-shift methodology is utilized in order to classify brain voxels into one of three main tissue types: gray matter, white matter, and cerebro-spinal fluid. The {MRI} image space is represented by a high-dimensional feature space that includes multimodal intensity features as well as spatial features. An adaptive mean-shift algorithm clusters the joint spatial-intensity feature space, thus extracting a representative set of high-density points within the feature space, otherwise known as modes. Tissue segmentation is obtained by a follow-up phase of intensity-based mode clustering into the three tissue categories. By its nonparametric nature, adaptive mean-shift can deal successfully with nonconvex clusters and produce convergence modes that are better candidates for intensity based classification than the initial voxels. The proposed method is validated on 3-D single and multimodal datasets, for both simulated and real {MRI} data. It is shown to perform well in comparison to other state-of-the-art methods without the use of a preregistered statistical brain atlas.},

Computer simulations and validation experiments using a flow phantom were carried out to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method for measuring blood T1 by taking advantage of the continuous inflow of fresh blood with longitudinal magnetization undisturbed by previous radiofrequency pulses. In vivo measurement of venous blood T1 in the sagittal sinus was carried out in 26 healthy children and adults aged 7–39 years. The measured venous blood T1 values decreased with age as a whole (P = 0.006) and were higher in females than males (P = 0.013), matching the expected developmental changes and gender differences in human hematocrit level. The estimated mean blood T1 values were highly correlated with normal hematocrit levels across age and gender groups (Spearman's r = 0.93, P = 0.008). The longitudinal repeatability of this technique was 4.0\% as measured by the within-subject coefficient of variation. The proposed multiphase inversion recovery-prepared balanced steady-state free precession imaging method is a feasible technique for fast ({\textless}1 min) and reliable in vivo venous blood T1 measurement and may serve as an index of hematocrit level in individual subjects.

Traditional neurobiological and cognitive explanations for adolescent behavior have failed to account for the nonlinear changes in behavior observed during adolescence, relative to both childhood and adulthood. This review provides a biologically plausible model of the neural mechanisms underlying these nonlinear changes in behavior. We provide evidence from recent human brain imaging and animal studies that there is a heightened responsiveness to incentives and socioemotional contexts during this time, when impulse control is still relatively immature. These findings suggest differential development of bottom-up limbic systems, implicated in incentive and emotional processing, to top-down control systems during adolescence as compared to childhood and adulthood. This developmental pattern may be exacerbated in those adolescents prone to emotional reactivity, increasing the likelihood of poor outcomes.},

Methods Forty-seven whole-brain voxel-based meta-analyses including voxel-based morphometry ({VBM)} studies in neuropsychiatric conditions were included, for a total of 324 individual {VBM} studies. The total sample size, the overall number of foci, and different moderators were extracted both at the level of the individual studies and at the level of the meta-analyses. Results Sample size ranged from 12 to 545 (median n = 47) per {VBM} study. The median number of reported foci per study was six. {VBM} studies with larger sample sizes reported only slightly more abnormalities than smaller studies (2\% increase in the number of foci per 10-patients increase in sample size). A similar pattern was seen in several analyses according to different moderator variables with some possible modulating evidence for the statistical threshold employed, publication year and number of coauthors. Whole-brain meta-analyses (median sample size n = 534) found fewer foci (median = 3) than single studies and overall they showed no significant increase in the number of foci with increasing sample size. Meta-analyses with ≥10 {VBM} studies reported a median of three foci and showed a significant increase with increasing sample size, while there was no relationship between sample size and number of foci (median = 5) in meta-analyses with {\textless}10 {VBM} studies. Conclusions The number of foci reported in small {VBM} studies and even in meta-analyses with few studies may often be inflated.

	abstract = {We describe techniques for the robust detection of community structure in some classes of time-dependent networks. Specifically, we consider the use of statistical null models for facilitating the principled identification of structural modules in semi-decomposable systems. Null models play an important role both in the optimization of quality functions such as modularity and in the subsequent assessment of the statistical validity of identified community structure. We examine the sensitivity of such methods to model parameters and show how comparisons to null models can help identify system scales. By considering a large number of optimizations, we quantify the variance of network diagnostics over optimizations (“optimization variance”) and over randomizations of network structure (“randomization variance”). Because the modularity quality function typically has a large number of nearly degenerate local optima for networks constructed using real data, we develop a method to construct representative partitions that uses a null model to correct for statistical noise in sets of partitions. To illustrate our results, we employ ensembles of time-dependent networks extracted from both nonlinear oscillators and empirical neuroscience data.},

The tests selected for this study measured the primary cognitive manifestations of {AD} across a range of severity of the disorder, and discriminated between normal subjects and those with mild and moderate dementia. The batteries also detected deterioration of language, memory, praxis, and general intellectual status in subjects returning for reassessment 1 year later. Interrater and test-retest reliabilities were substantial. Long-term observations of this cohort are in progress in an effort to validate the clinical and neuropsychological assessments and to confirm the diagnosis by postmortem examinations.

Specifically, existing data have not been entirely consistent regarding the spatial distribution of such changes, potentially a result of neglecting the effect of age-related tissue atrophy in {CBF} measurements. In this work, we use pulsed arterial-spin labelling to quantify regional {CBF} in 86 cognitively and physically healthy adults, aged 23 to 88 years. Surface-based analyses were utilized to map regional decline in {CBF} and cortical thickness with advancing age, and to examine the spatial associations and dissociations between these metrics. Our results demonstrate regionally selective age-related reductions in cortical perfusion, involving the superior-frontal, orbito-frontal, superior-parietal, middle-inferior temporal, insular, precuneus, supramarginal, lateral-occipital and cingulate regions, while subcortical {CBF} was relatively preserved in aging. Regional effects of age on {CBF} differed from that of grey-matter atrophy. In addition, the pattern of {CBF} associations with age displays an interesting similarity with the default-mode network. These findings demonstrate the dissociation between regional {CBF} and structural alterations specific to normal aging, and augment our understanding of mechanisms of pathology in older adults.},

At birth, cortical {rCBFs} were lower than those for adults; after birth they increased until 5 or 6 yr of age to values 50\%-85\% higher than those for adults and thereafter decreased, reaching adult levels between 15 and 19 yr. Neonatal values of {rCBF} on cerebellum and thalamus were slightly higher than adult level, but not significantly; after age 1, they followed the common pattern for cortical curves. When {rCBFs} were expressed in percent global {CBF}, they were lower at birth than adult levels in the cortex, then increased and reached a plateau corresponding to the adult value before the second year of age. The time needed to reach normal adult values differed for each cortical region. The shortest time was found on the primary cortex and the longest on the associative cortex.

	abstract = {The remarkable antiquity, diversity, and significance in the ecology and evolution of Cetartiodactyla have inspired numerous attempts to resolve their phylogenetic relationships. However, previous analyses based on limited samples of nuclear genes or mitochondrial {DNA} sequences have generated results that were either inconsistent with one another, weakly supported, or highly sensitive to analytical conditions. Here, we present strongly supported results based upon over 1.4 Mb of an aligned {DNA} sequence matrix from 110 single-copy nuclear protein-coding genes of 21 Cetartiodactyla species, which represent major Cetartiodactyla lineages, and three species of Perissodactyla and Carnivora as outgroups. Phylogenetic analysis of this newly developed genomic sequence data using a codon-based model and recently developed models of the rate autocorrelation resolved the phylogenetic relationships of the major cetartiodactylan lineages and of those lineages with a high degree of confidence. Cetacea was found to nest within Artiodactyla as the sister group of Hippopotamidae, and Tylopoda was corroborated as the sole base clade of Cetartiodactyla. Within Cetacea, the monophyletic status of Odontoceti relative to Mysticeti, the basal position of Physeteroidea in Odontoceti, the non-monophyly of the river dolphins, and the sister relationship between Delphinidae and {Monodontidae+Phocoenidae} were strongly supported. In particular, the groups of Tursiops (bottlenose dolphins) and Stenella (spotted dolphins) were validated as unnatural groups. Additionally, a very narrow time frame of ∼3 My (million years) was found for the rapid diversification of delphinids in the late Miocene, which made it difficult to resolve the phylogenetic relationships within the Delphinidae, especially for previous studies with limited data sets. The present study provides a statistically well-supported phylogenetic framework of Cetartiodactyla, which represents an important step toward ending some of the often-heated, century-long debate on their evolution.},

This paper presents two versions of the proposed sparse classifier, a 2-norm {SVM} and a 1-norm {SVM}, the latter having a reduced computational burden with respect to the first one. Additionally, an explanation is provided about how the presented approach can be readily extended to multiclass classification or to problems where groups of features, rather than isolated features, need to be selected. The algorithms have been tested in a variety of synthetic and real data sets and they have been compared against other state of the art {SVM-based} linear feature selection methods, such as 1-norm {SVM} and doubly regularized {SVM.} The results show the good feature selection ability of the approaches.},

Necropsy data indicate a similar age-related prevalence and suggest that atherosclerosis risk factors are operative from a very early age. The {IVUS} findings show that disease is characteristically diffuse and involves the entire arterial tree, with progression including formation of multiple, potentially rupture-prone plaques that are not associated with vessel stenosis.

	abstract = {We propose a framework for the extraction of biomarkers from low-dimensional manifolds representing inter-subject brain variation. Manifold coordinates of each image capture information about structural shape and appearance and, when a phenotype exists, about the subject's clinical state. Our framework incorporates subject meta-information into the manifold learning step. Apart from gender and age, information such as genotype or a derived biomarker is often available in clinical studies and can inform the classification of a query subject. Such information, whether discrete or continuous, is used as an additional input to manifold learning, extending the Laplacian Eigenmap objective function and enriching a similarity measure derived from pairwise image similarities. The biomarkers identified with the proposed method are data-driven in contrast to a priori defined biomarkers derived from, e.g., manual or automated segmentations. They form a unified representation of both the imaging and non-imaging measurements, providing a natural use for data analysis and visualization. We test the method to classify subjects with Alzheimer's Disease ({AD)}, mild cognitive impairment ({MCI)} and healthy controls enrolled in the {ADNI} study. Non-imaging metadata used are {ApoE} genotype, a risk factor associated with {AD}, and the {CSF-concentration} of Aβ(1-42), an established biomarker for {AD.} In addition, we use hippocampal volume as a derived imaging-biomarker to enrich the learned manifold. Our classification results compare favorably to what has been reported in a recent meta-analysis using established neuroimaging methods on the same database.},

	abstract = {A new approach is presented for elastic registration of medical images, and is applied to magnetic resonance images of the brain. Experimental results demonstrate very high accuracy in superposition of images from different subjects. There are two major novelties in the proposed algorithm. First, it uses an attribute vector, i.e., a set of geometric moment invariants ({GMIs)} that are defined on each voxel in an image and are calculated from the tissue maps, to reflect the underlying anatomy at different scales. The attribute vector, if rich enough, can distinguish between different parts of an image, which helps establish anatomical correspondences in the deformation procedure; it also helps reduce local minima, by reducing ambiguity in potential matches. This is a fundamental deviation of our method, referred to as the hierarchical attribute matching mechanism for elastic registration ({HAMMER)}, from other volumetric deformation methods, which are typically based on maximizing image similarity. Second, in order to avoid being trapped by local minima, i.e., suboptimal poor matches, {HAMMER} uses a successive approximation of the energy function being optimized by lower dimensional smooth energy functions, which are constructed to have significantly fewer local minima. This is achieved by hierarchically selecting the driving features that have distinct attribute vectors, thus, drastically reducing ambiguity in finding correspondence. A number of experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm results in accurate superposition of image data from individuals with significant anatomical differences.},

In conventional medical practice, resolution enhancement is usually performed with bicubic or B-spline interpolations, strongly affecting the accuracy of subsequent processing steps such as segmentation or registration. This paper presents a sparse-based super-resolution method, adapted for easily including prior knowledge, which couples up high and low frequency information so that a high-resolution version of a low-resolution brain {MR} image is generated. The proposed approach includes a whole-image multi-scale edge analysis and a dimensionality reduction scheme, which results in a remarkable improvement of the computational speed and accuracy, taking nearly 26 min to generate a complete {3D} high-resolution reconstruction. The method was validated by comparing interpolated and reconstructed versions of 29 {MR} brain volumes with the original images, acquired in a {3T} scanner, obtaining a reduction of 70\% in the root mean squared error, an increment of 10.3 {dB} in the peak signal-to-noise ratio, and an agreement of 85\% in the binary gray matter segmentations. The proposed method is shown to outperform a recent state-of-the-art algorithm, suggesting a substantial impact in voxel-based morphometry studies.},

Whenever a sequence constructed by an algorithm in this family enters a sufficiently small neighborhood of a local minimizer ○ satisfying standard second-order sufficiency conditions, it gets trapped and converges to this local minimizer. Furthermore, in this case, the active constraint set at ○ is identified in a finite number of iterations. This fact is used to ensure that the rate of convergence to a local minimizer, satisfying standard second-order sufficiency conditions, depends only on the behavior of the algorithm in the unconstrained subspace. As a particular example, we present projected versions of the modified {Polak–Ribière} conjugate gradient method and the limited-memory {BFGS} quasi-Newton method that retain the convergence properties associated with those algorithms applied to unconstrained problems.},

A key concept shared by both approaches is the notion of sparsity. In this paper we investigate how the framework of sparse representations can be applied in various stages of manifold learning. We explore the use of sparse representations in two major components of manifold learning: construction of the weight matrix and classification of test data. In addition, we investigate the benefits that are offered by introducing a weighting scheme on the sparse representations framework via the weighted {LASSO} algorithm. The underlying manifold learning approach is based on the recently proposed spectral regression framework that offers significant benefits compared to previously proposed manifold learning techniques.

	abstract = {Therapeutic development in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ({ALS)} is hampered by the lack of suitable biomarkers that might be sensitive to spatial and temporal patterns of neurodegeneration. Diffusion tensor imaging is a useful non-invasive tool that permits detection of microstructural tissue changes due, for example, to neurodegeneration. Even though the spinal cord bears the brunt of the disease process, diffusion tensor imaging has mainly been used to study white matter changes in the brain. The aim of this study was to examine the diffusion tensor imaging parameters of the cervical spinal cord (C1 through C6 segments) and brainstem (corticospinal tracts in the pyramids and pons) among {ALS} patients, to compare these to findings in age-matched healthy controls, and to correlate these differences with clinical measures of disease severity. Fractional anisotropy in the white matter of the cervical cord was 12\% lower (p{\textless}0.01) in {ALS} patients (n=14) compared to age-matched healthy control subjects (n=15), and showed significant positive correlation with the average finger and foot tapping speed (r=0.61, p{\textless}0.05) in {ALS} patients. Radial diffusivity in the cervical cord was 15\% higher (p{\textless}0.05) in {ALS} patients compared to healthy control subjects. Radial diffusivity in the white matter of the cervical cord was significantly correlated with clinical measures of disease severity such as forced vital capacity ({FVC} \% predicted, r=-0.69, p{\textless}0.01), average finger and foot tapping speed from all four limbs (r=-0.59, p{\textless}0.05), and {ALSFRS-R} (r=-0.55, p{\textless}0.05) in {ALS} patients. There were no significant differences in mean diffusivity or axial diffusivity in the cervical spinal cord, or in any diffusion tensor imaging parameters measured in the brainstem. Analysis of diffusion tensor imaging parameters from individual cervical segments as well as profile plots along the length of the cervical cord showed larger differences in fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity at more distal cervical segments, providing evidence that supports the "dying-back" hypothesis of neurodegeneration in {ALS.}},

Compared with pattern classification studies, pattern regression considers the problem of estimating continuous rather than categorical variables, and can be more challenging. It is also clinically important, since it can be used to estimate disease stage and predict clinical progression from images. In this work, adaptive regional feature extraction approach is used along with other common feature extraction methods, and feature selection technique is adopted to produce a small number of discriminative features for optimal regression performance. Then the Relevance Vector Machine ({RVM)} is used to build regression models based on selected features. To get stable regression models from limited training samples, a bagging framework is adopted to build ensemble basis regressors derived from multiple bootstrap training samples, and thus to alleviate the effects of outliers as well as facilitate the optimal model parameter selection. Finally, this regression scheme is tested on simulated data and real data via cross-validation. Experimental results demonstrate that this regression scheme achieves higher estimation accuracy and better generalizing ability than Support Vector Regression ({SVR).}},

Our aim in this study was to determine the joint contribution of structural and perfusion-weighted imaging for the classification of {AD} in a cross-sectional study using an integrated multimodality {MRI} processing framework and a cortical surface-based analysis approach. We used logistic regression analysis to determine sequentially the value of cortical thickness, {rCBF}, and cortical thickness and {rCBF} jointly for classification for diagnosis of {AD} compared to controls. We further tested the extent to which cortical thinning and reduced {rCBF} explain individually or together variability in dementia severity. Separate analysis of structural {MRI} and perfusion-weighted {MRI} data yielded the well-established pattern of cortical thinning and {rCBF} reduction in {AD}, affecting predominantly temporo-parietal brain regions. Using structural {MRI} and perfusion-weighted {MRI} jointly indicated that cortical thinning dominated the classification of {AD} and controls without significant contributions from {rCBF.} However there was also a positive interaction between reduced {rCBF} and cortical thinning in the right superior temporal sulcus, implying that structural and physiological brain alterations in {AD} can be complementary. Compared to reduced {rCBF}, regional cortical thinning better explained the variability in dementia severity. In conclusion, structural brain alterations compared to physiological variations are the dominant features of {MRI} in {AD.}},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE} {OF} {REVIEW}

In 2011, a new set of new guidelines for the research diagnosis of three stages of Alzheimer disease was promulgated by the {US} National Institute of Aging and the Alzheimer Association. For the first time, they include the diagnosis of presymptomatic Alzheimer disease, recognizing that the disease process begins years before cognitive impairment develops. Awareness of this fact has largely been driven by neuroimaging, and particularly by imaging amyloid β (abeta) deposition in the brain, a procedure approved by the {US} Food and Drug Administration for clinical use in April 2012.


{RECENT} {FINDINGS}

In Alzheimer disease, abeta deposition antecedes, probably by decades, the onset of cognitive impairment. In brain regions with greatest abeta deposition, synaptic dysfunction can be imaged beginning at preclinical stages. In regions that are not identical with the ones with greatest abeta deposition but heavily connected with them, regional atrophy and loss of white-matter anisotropy can be detected later in the course of the disease, near the time when mild cognitive impairment supervenes. Together with neuropsychological testing, imaging can improve the prediction of worsening to Alzheimer disease among patients with mild cognitive impairment.


{SUMMARY}

These findings have huge implications for research on therapeutic approaches to Alzheimer disease. For instance, while so far only patients with the clinical diagnosis have been treated with immunotherapy targeting abeta removal, a consensus is building that to be effective, this therapy should be given in the preclinical stages of the disease, which are assessed most advantageously by means of neuroimaging.},

Our framework constructs normative growth models for all the modalities, taking into account the correlation among the modalities and individuals, along with estimation of the variability of the population trends.

	abstract = {The United States National Institutes of Health ({NIH)} commit significant support to open-source data and software resources in order to foment reproducibility in the biomedical imaging sciences. Here, we report and evaluate a recent product of this commitment: Advanced Neuroimaging Tools ({ANTs)}, which is approaching its 2.0 release. The {ANTs} open source software library consists of a suite of state-of-the-art image registration, segmentation and template building tools for quantitative morphometric analysis. In this work, we use {ANTs} to quantify, for the first time, the impact of similarity metrics on the affine and deformable components of a template-based normalization study. We detail the {ANTs} implementation of three similarity metrics: squared intensity difference, a new and faster cross-correlation, and voxel-wise mutual information. We then use two-fold cross-validation to compare their performance on openly available, manually labeled, T1-weighted {MRI} brain image data of 40 subjects ({UCLA's} {LPBA40} dataset). We report evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for both the affine and deformable components of the registration. Results indicate that the best {ANTs} methods are competitive with existing brain extraction results (Jaccard = 0.958) and cortical labeling approaches. Mutual information affine mapping combined with cross-correlation diffeomorphic mapping gave the best cortical labeling results (Jaccard = 0.669 ± 0.022). Furthermore, our two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify the similarity of templates derived from different subgroups. Our open code, data and evaluation scripts set performance benchmark parameters for this state-of-the-art toolkit. This is the first study to use a consistent transformation framework to provide a reproducible evaluation of the isolated effect of the similarity metric on optimal template construction and brain labeling.},

We contend that this problem can be tackled by mapping the pixels into various feature-spaces, whereupon they are subjected to a grouping algorithm. In this paper we develop a robust and versatile nonparametric clustering algorithm that is able to handle the unbalanced and highly irregular clusters encountered in such {CBIR} applications. The strength of our approach lies not so much in the clustering itself, but rather in the definition and use of two cluster-validity indices that are independent of the cluster topology. By combining them, an optimal clustering can be identified, and experiments confirm that the associated clusters do, indeed, correspond to perceptually salient image regions.},

Here we developed a novel data mining framework in combination with three different classifiers including support vector machine ({SVM)}, Bayes statistics, and voting feature intervals ({VFI)} to derive a quantitative index of pattern matching for the prediction of the conversion from {MCI} to {AD.} {MRI} was collected in 32 {AD} patients, 24 {MCI} subjects and 18 healthy controls ({HC).} Nine out of 24 {MCI} subjects converted to {AD} after an average follow-up interval of 2.5 years. Using feature selection algorithms, brain regions showing the highest accuracy for the discrimination between {AD} and {HC} were identified, reaching a classification accuracy of up to 92\%. The extracted {AD} clusters were used as a search region to extract those brain areas that are predictive of conversion to {AD} within {MCI} subjects. The most predictive brain areas included the anterior cingulate gyrus and orbitofrontal cortex. The best prediction accuracy, which was cross-validated via train-and-test, was 75\% for the prediction of the conversion from {MCI} to {AD.} The present results suggest that novel multivariate methods of pattern matching reach a clinically relevant accuracy for the a priori prediction of the progression from {MCI} to {AD.} © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

	doi = {10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.12.021},
	abstract = {Exploratory (i.e., voxelwise) spatial methods are commonly used in neuroimaging to identify areas that show an effect when a region-of-interest ({ROI)} analysis cannot be performed because no strong a priori anatomical hypothesis exists. However, noise at a single voxel is much higher than noise in a {ROI} making noise management critical to successful exploratory analysis. This work explores how preprocessing choices affect the bias and variability of voxelwise kinetic modeling analysis of brain positron emission tomography ({PET)} data. These choices include the use of volume- or cortical surface-based smoothing, level of smoothing, use of voxelwise partial volume correction ({PVC)}, and {PVC} masking threshold. {PVC} was implemented using the Muller-Gartner method with the masking out of voxels with low gray matter ({GM)} partial volume fraction. Dynamic {PET} scans of an antagonist serotonin-4 receptor radioligand ([{11C]SB2307145)} were collected on sixteen healthy subjects using a Siemens {HRRT} {PET} scanner. Kinetic modeling was used to compute maps of non-displaceable binding potential ({BPND)} after preprocessing. The results showed a complicated interaction between smoothing, {PVC}, and masking on {BPND} estimates. Volume-based smoothing resulted in large bias and intersubject variance because it smears signal across tissue types. In some cases, {PVC} with volume smoothing paradoxically caused the estimated {BPND} to be less than when no {PVC} was used at all. When applied in the absence of {PVC}, cortical surface-based smoothing resulted in dramatically less bias and the least variance of the methods tested for smoothing levels 5 mm and higher. When used in combination with {PVC}, surface-based smoothing minimized the bias without significantly increasing the variance. Surface-based smoothing resulted in 2-4 times less intersubject variance than when volume smoothing was used. This translates into more than 4 times fewer subjects needed in a group analysis to achieve similarly powered statistical tests. Surface-based smoothing has less bias and variance because it respects cortical geometry by smoothing the {PET} data only along the cortical ribbon and so does not contaminate the {GM} signal with that of white matter and cerebrospinal fluid. The use of surface-based analysis in {PET} should result in substantial improvements in the reliability and detectability of effects in exploratory {PET} analysis, with or without {PVC.}},

	abstract = {Functional neuroimaging studies have started unravelling unexpected functional attributes for the posteromedial portion of the parietal lobe, the precuneus. This cortical area has traditionally received little attention, mainly because of its hidden location and the virtual absence of focal lesion studies. However, recent functional imaging findings in healthy subjects suggest a central role for the precuneus in a wide spectrum of highly integrated tasks, including visuo-spatial imagery, episodic memory retrieval and self-processing operations, namely first-person perspective taking and an experience of agency. Furthermore, precuneus and surrounding posteromedial areas are amongst the brain structures displaying the highest resting metabolic rates (hot spots) and are characterized by transient decreases in the tonic activity during engagement in non-self-referential goal-directed actions (default mode of brain function). Therefore, it has recently been proposed that precuneus is involved in the interwoven network of the neural correlates of self-consciousness, engaged in self-related mental representations during rest. This hypothesis is consistent with the selective hypometabolism in the posteromedial cortex reported in a wide range of altered conscious states, such as sleep, drug-induced anaesthesia and vegetative states. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the macroscopic and microscopic anatomy of precuneus, together with its wide-spread connectivity with both cortical and subcortical structures, as shown by connectional and neurophysiological findings in non-human primates, and links these notions with the multifaceted spectrum of its behavioural correlates. By means of a critical analysis of precuneus activation patterns in response to different mental tasks, this paper provides a useful conceptual framework for matching the functional imaging findings with the specific role(s) played by this structure in the higher-order cognitive functions in which it has been implicated. Specifically, activation patterns appear to converge with anatomical and connectivity data in providing preliminary evidence for a functional subdivision within the precuneus into an anterior region, involved in self-centred mental imagery strategies, and a posterior region, subserving successful episodic memory retrieval.},

Computational anatomy with magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} is well established as a noninvasive biomarker of Alzheimer's disease ({AD);} however, there is less certainty about its dependency on the staging of {AD.} We use classical group analyses and automated machine learning classification of standard structural {MRI} scans to investigate {AD} diagnostic accuracy from the preclinical phase to clinical dementia. Longitudinal data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were stratified into 4 groups according to the clinical status—(1) {AD} patients; (2) mild cognitive impairment ({MCI)} converters; (3) {MCI} nonconverters; and (4) healthy controls—and submitted to a support vector machine. The obtained classifier was significantly above the chance level (62\%) for detecting {AD} already 4 years before conversion from {MCI.} Voxel-based univariate tests confirmed the plausibility of our findings detecting a distributed network of hippocampal-temporoparietal atrophy in {AD} patients. We also identified a subgroup of control subjects with brain structure and cognitive changes highly similar to those observed in {AD.} Our results indicate that computational anatomy can detect {AD} substantially earlier than suggested by current models. The demonstrated differential spatial pattern of atrophy between correctly and incorrectly classified {AD} patients challenges the assumption of a uniform pathophysiological process underlying clinically identified {AD.}},

	abstract = {Objective. The objective of this study was to assess the age-related variations of brain perfusion through quantitative cerebral perfusion computed tomography ({CT)} results in children without brain abnormality.
Methods. Brain perfusion {CT} examinations were performed in 77 children, aged 7 days to 18 years. These patients were admitted at our institution for both noncontrast and contrast-enhanced cerebral {CT.} Only children whose conventional cerebral {CT} and clinical/radiologic follow-up, including additional investigations, were normal were taken into account for this study (53 of 77).
Results. The average regional {rCBF} amounts to 40 ({mL/100} g per minute) for the first 6 months of life, peaks at ∼130 ({mL/100} g per minute) at ∼2 to 4 years of age, and finally stabilizes at ∼50 ({mL/100} g per minute) at ∼7 to 8 years of age, with a small increase of {rCBF} values at ∼12 years of age. The {rCBF} in the gray matter averages 3 times that in the white matter, except for the first 6 months of life. The global {CBF} represents 10\% to 20\% of the global cardiac output for the first 6 months of life, peaks at ∼55\% by 2 to 4 years of age, and finally stabilizes at ∼15\% by 7 to 8 years of age. Specific age-related evolution patterns were identified in the different anatomic areas of the cerebral parenchyma, which could be related to the development of neuroanatomic structures and to the emergence of corresponding cognitive functions.
Conclusions. Quantitative perfusion {CT} characterization of brain perfusion shows specific age variations. Brain perfusion of each cortical area evolves according to a specific time course, in close correlation with the psychomotor development.},

The goal is to transform very high-dimensional input (typically, millions of voxels) to a low-dimensional representation (small number of constructed features) that preserves discriminative signal and is clinically interpretable. We formulate the task as a constrained optimization problem that combines generative and discriminative objectives and show how to extend it to the semi-supervised learning ({SSL)} setting. We propose a novel large-scale algorithm to solve the resulting optimization problem. In the fully supervised case, we demonstrate accuracy rates that are better than or comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms on several datasets while producing a representation of the group difference that is consistent with prior clinical reports. Effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for {SSL} is evaluated with both benchmark and medical imaging datasets. In the benchmark datasets, the results are better than or comparable to the state-of-the-art methods for {SSL.} For evaluation of the {SSL} setting in medical datasets, we use images of subjects with mild cognitive impairment ({MCI)}, which is believed to be a precursor to Alzheimer's disease ({AD)}, as unlabeled data. {AD} subjects and normal control ({NC)} subjects are used as labeled data, and we try to predict conversion from {MCI} to {AD} on follow-up. The semi-supervised extension of this method not only improves the generalization accuracy for the labeled data ({AD/NC)} slightly but is also able to predict subjects which are likely to converge to {AD.} © 2011 {IEEE.}},

To develop and validate a tool for Alzheimer's disease ({AD)} diagnosis in individual subjects using support vector machine ({SVM)-based} classification of structural {MR} ({sMR)} images.


{BACKGROUND}

Libraries of {sMR} scans of clinically well characterized subjects can be harnessed for the purpose of diagnosing new incoming subjects.


{METHODS}

One hundred ninety patients with probable {AD} were age- and gender-matched with 190 cognitively normal ({CN)} subjects. Three different classification models were implemented: Model I uses tissue densities obtained from {sMR} scans to give {STructural} Abnormality {iNDex} ({STAND)-score;} and Models {II} and {III} use tissue densities as well as covariates (demographics and Apolipoprotein E genotype) to give adjusted-{STAND} ({aSTAND)-score.} Data from 140 {AD} and 140 {CN} were used for training. The {SVM} parameter optimization and training were done by four-fold cross validation ({CV).} The remaining independent sample of 50 {AD} and 50 {CN} was used to obtain a minimally biased estimate of the generalization error of the algorithm.


{RESULTS}

The {CV} accuracy of Model {II} and Model {III} {aSTAND-scores} was 88.5\% and 89.3\%, respectively, and the developed models generalized well on the independent test data sets. Anatomic patterns best differentiating the groups were consistent with the known distribution of neurofibrillary {AD} pathology.


{CONCLUSIONS}

This paper presents preliminary evidence that application of {SVM-based} classification of an individual {sMR} scan relative to a library of scans can provide useful information in individual subjects for diagnosis of {AD.} Including demographic and genetic information in the classification algorithm slightly improves diagnostic accuracy.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease ({AD)} is the seventh leading cause of all deaths in the United States and is virtually tied with the sixth leading cause of death-diabetes. {AD} is the fifth leading cause of death in Americans aged 65 and older. Although other major causes of death have been on the decrease, deaths because of {AD} have been rising dramatically. Between 2000 and 2006, heart disease deaths decreased 11.1\%, stroke deaths decreased 18.2\%, and prostate cancer-related deaths decreased 8.7\%, whereas deaths because of {AD} increased 46.1\%. Older African-Americans and Hispanics are more likely than older white Americans to have {AD} or other dementia. Current estimates are that African-Americans are about 2 times more likely, and Hispanics about 1.5 times more likely, than their white counterparts to have these conditions. However, the relationship of race and ethnicity to the development of {AD} and other dementias is complex and not fully understood. In 2009, nearly 11 million family and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 12.5 billion hours of care to persons with {AD} and other dementias; this care is valued at nearly \$144 billion. Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries aged 65 years and older with {AD} and other dementias are three times higher than for beneficiaries without these conditions. Total payments for 2010 for health care and long-term care services for people aged 65 and older with {AD} and other dementias are expected to be \$172 billion (not including the contributions of unpaid caregivers). An estimated 5.3 million Americans have {AD;} approximately 200,000 persons under age 65 with {AD} comprise the younger-onset {AD} population. Every 70 seconds, someone in America develops {AD;} by 2050 the time of every 70 seconds is expected to decrease to every 33 seconds. Over the coming decades, the baby boom population is projected to add 10 million people to these numbers. In 2050, the incidence of {AD} is expected to approach nearly a million people per year, with a total estimated prevalence of 11-16 million people. Dramatic increases in the numbers of "oldest old" (aged 85 years and older) across all racial and ethnic groups will also significantly affect the numbers of people living with {AD.} This report provides information to increase understanding of the public health effect of {AD}, including incidence and prevalence, mortality, costs of care, and effect on caregivers and society in general. This report also sets the stage for better understanding the relationship between race and ethnicity and the development of {AD} and other dementias.},

While macroscopic stroke can clearly produce cognitive deficits and accelerate Alzheimer's disease, the prevalence and implications of microvascular disease in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis has been harder to define. At present, white matter ({WM)} lesions, primarily defined as hyperintensities seen on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)}, provide the best biomarker of cerebrovascular disease at the microvascular level. However, T2 hyperintensities in {WM} can also be caused by other mechanisms such as inflammation. Arterial spin labeled ({ASL)} perfusion {MRI} provides a noninvasive approach for quantifying cerebral blood flow ({CBF).} We explored {CBF} measurements with {ASL} in {AD} patients, mild cognitive impairment patients, and an age-matched control group to determine if {CBF} in gray matter or {WM} could be correlated with {WM} lesions, or to stratify patients by microvascular disease severity. In a retrospective sample, we were able to obtain credible measures of {WM} {CBF} using {ASL} {MRI} and observed trends suggesting that {WM} {CBF} may provide a useful biomarker of microvascular disease. Future prospective studies in larger cohorts with optimized {ASL} {MRI} protocols will be needed to validate these observations.},

	abstract = {Recent discussions within the neuroimaging community have highlighted the problematic presence of selection bias in experimental design. Although initially centering on the selection of voxels during the course of {fMRI} studies, we demonstrate how this bias can potentially corrupt voxel-based analyses. For such studies, template-based registration plays a critical role in which a representative template serves as the normalized space for group alignment. A standard approach maps each subject's image to a representative template before performing statistical comparisons between different groups. We analytically demonstrate that in these scenarios the popular sum of squared difference ({SSD)} intensity metric, implicitly surrogating as a quantification of anatomical alignment, instead explicitly maximizes effect size-an experimental design flaw referred to as "circularity bias." We illustrate how this selection bias varies in strength with the similarity metric used during registration under the hypothesis that while {SSD-related} metrics, such as Demons, will manifest similar effects, other metrics which are not formulated based on absolute intensity differences will produce less of an effect. Consequently, given the variability in voxel-based analysis outcomes with similarity metric choice, we caution researchers specifically in the use of {SSD} and {SSD-related} measures where normalization and statistical analysis involve the same image set. Instead, we advocate a more cautious approach where normalization of the individual subject images to the reference space occurs through corresponding image sets which are independent of statistical testing. Alternatively, one can use similarity terms that are less sensitive to this bias. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Isomap is one of the most promising nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques. However, when Isomap is applied to real-world data, it shows some limitations, such as being sensitive to noise. In this paper, an improved version of Isomap, namely S-Isomap, is proposed. S-Isomap utilizes class information to guide the procedure of nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Such a kind of procedure is called supervised nonlinear dimensionality reduction. In S-Isomap, the neighborhood graph of the input data is constructed according to a certain kind of dissimilarity between data points, which is specially designed to integrate the class information. The dissimilarity has several good properties which help to discover the true neighborhood of the data and, thus, makes S-Isomap a robust technique for both visualization and classification, especially for real-world problems. In the visualization experiments, S-Isomap is compared with Isomap, {LLE}, and {WeightedIso.} The results show that S-Isomap performs the best. In the classification experiments, S-Isomap is used as a preprocess of classification and compared with Isomap, {WeightedIso}, as well as some other well-established classification methods, including the K-nearest neighbor classifier, {BP} neural network, J4.8 decision tree, and {SVM.} The results reveal that S-Isomap excels compared to Isomap and {WeightedIso} in classification, and it is highly competitive with those well-known classification methods.},

	abstract = {We present a novel multivariate machine learning approach to the identification of voxel clusters containing brain state discriminating information, serving as a potentially more sensitive alternative to univariate activation detection. The proposed method consists of an evolutionary algorithm that, in conjunction with a classifier, extracts voxel clusters with a classification score above a pre-defined, above-chance threshold. The results can be displayed as two- or three-dimensional voxel discrimination relevance maps ({VDRMs)}, indicating where and to what degree brain state classification is possible. When applied to a finger-tapping dataset numerous voxel clusters with impressive classification rates were identified, at best scoring an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ({ROC)-curve} ({AUC)} of 1 within as well as between subjects. The location of high-scoring regions correlated well with functionally relevant areas as defined by the general linear model ({GLM).} Combining clusters for maximal classification scores as a feature selection approach outperformed the {GLM} T-map voxel ranking method (e.g., group level {AUC} of 0.908 compared to 0.785 for one cluster/200 voxels). Moreover, on data from a tactile study we show that the proposed algorithm can produce significant brain state discrimination scores where both the {GLM} and {ROI-based} classification fail to detect significantly activated voxels. Finally, we demonstrate that the algorithm can be successfully applied to data with more than two conditions and hence produce multiclass voxel relevance maps. The proposed evolutionary classification scheme has thus proven excellent in identifying voxel clusters that contain information about given brain states, which can be utilized not only for maximal single-volume {fMRI} classification, but also for multivariate, multiclass, highly sensitive functional brain mapping.},

	abstract = {A technique has been developed for proton magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} of perfusion, using water as a freely diffusable tracer, and its application to the measurement of cerebral blood flow ({CBF)} in the rat is demonstrated. The method involves labeling the inflowing water proton spins in the arterial blood by inverting them continuously at the neck region and observing the effects of inversion on the intensity of brain {MRI.} Solution to the Bloch equations, modified to include the effects of flow, allows regional perfusion rates to be measured from an image with spin inversion, a control image, and a T1 image. Continuous spin inversion labeling the arterial blood water was accomplished, using principles of adiabatic fast passage by applying continuous-wave radiofrequency power in the presence of a magnetic field gradient in the direction of arterial flow. In the detection slice used to measure perfusion, whole brain {CBF} averaged 1.39 +/- 0.19 ml.g-1.min-1 (mean +/- {SEM}, n = 5). The technique's sensitivity to changes in {CBF} was measured by using graded hypercarbia, a condition that is known to increase brain perfusion. {CBF} vs. {pCO2} data yield a best-fit straight line described by {CBF} (ml.g-1.min-1) = {0.052pCO2} (mm Hg) - 0.173, in excellent agreement with values in the literature. Finally, perfusion images of a freeze-injured rat brain have been obtained, demonstrating the technique's ability to detect regional abnormalities in perfusion.},

The complex and often subtle and nonlinear ways in which various factors, such as age, sex, genotype and disease, can affect brain morphology, suggest that alternative, unbiased methods based on statistical learning theory might be able to better quantify brain changes that are due to a variety of factors, especially when relationships between brain networks, rather than individual structures, and disease are examined.},

Spatial resolution-related effects, referred to as ‘partial volume effects’ ({PVEs)}, depend not only on the characteristics of the imaging system but also on the object and activity distribution. Spatial and/or temporal variations in {PVE} can often be confounding factors. Partial volume correction ({PVC)} could in theory be achieved by some kind of inverse filtering technique, reversing the effect of the system {PSF.} However, these methods are limited, and usually lead to noise-amplification or image artefacts. Some form of regularization is therefore needed, and this can be achieved using information from co-registered anatomical images, such as {CT} or {MRI.} The purpose of this paper is to enhance understanding of {PVEs} and to review possible approaches for {PVC.} We also present a review of clinical applications of {PVC} within the fields of neurology, cardiology and oncology, including specific examples.},

Our method yields a parts-based representation, which warranties that the image is decomposed into a number of positive regional projections.

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}

To evaluate the longitudinal repeatability and accuracy of cerebral blood flow ({CBF)} measurements by using pseudo-continuous arterial spin-labeled ({pCASL)} perfusion magnetic resonance ({MR)} imaging in typically developing children.


{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}

Institutional review board approval with {HIPAA} compliance and informed consent were obtained. Twenty-two children aged 7-17 years underwent repeated {pCASL} examinations 2-4 weeks apart with a 3-T {MR} imager, along with in vivo blood T1 and arterial transit time measurements. Phase-contrast ({PC)} {MR} imaging was performed as the reference standard for global blood flow volume. Intraclass correlation coefficient ({ICC)} and within-subject coefficient of variation ({wsCV)} were used to evaluate accuracy and repeatability.


{RESULTS}

The accuracy of {pCASL} against the reference standard of {PC} {MR} imaging increased on incorporating subjectwise in vivo blood T1 measurement ({ICC:} 0.32 vs 0.58). The {ICC} further increased to 0.65 by using a population-based model of blood T1. Additionally, {CBF} measurements with use of {pCASL} demonstrated a moderate to good level of longitudinal repeatability in whole brain ({ICC} = 0.61, {wsCV} = 15\%), in gray matter ({ICC} = 0.65, {wsCV} = 14\%), and across 16 brain regions (mean {ICC} = 0.55, {wsCV} = 17\%). The mean arterial transit time was 1538 msec ± 123 (standard deviation) in the pediatric cohort studied, which showed an increasing trend with age (P = .043).


{CONCLUSION}

Incorporating developmental changes in blood T1 is important for improving the accuracy of {pCASL} {CBF} measurements in children and adolescents; the noninvasive nature, accuracy, and longitudinal repeatability should facilitate the use of {pCASL} perfusion {MR} imaging in neurodevelopmental studies.},

	abstract = {The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ({ADNI)} is an ongoing, longitudinal, multicenter study designed to develop clinical, imaging, genetic, and biochemical biomarkers for the early detection and tracking of Alzheimer's disease ({AD).} The study aimed to enroll 400 subjects with early mild cognitive impairment ({MCI)}, 200 subjects with early {AD}, and 200 normal control subjects; \$67 million funding was provided by both the public and private sectors, including the National Institute on Aging, 13 pharmaceutical companies, and 2 foundations that provided support through the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health. This article reviews all papers published since the inception of the initiative and summarizes the results as of February 2011. The major accomplishments of {ADNI} have been as follows: (1) the development of standardized methods for clinical tests, magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)}, positron emission tomography ({PET)}, and cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF)} biomarkers in a multicenter setting; (2) elucidation of the patterns and rates of change of imaging and {CSF} biomarker measurements in control subjects, {MCI} patients, and {AD} patients. {CSF} biomarkers are consistent with disease trajectories predicted by β-amyloid cascade (Hardy, J Alzheimers Dis 2006;9(Suppl 3):151-3) and tau-mediated neurodegeneration hypotheses for {AD}, whereas brain atrophy and hypometabolism levels show predicted patterns but exhibit differing rates of change depending on region and disease severity; (3) the assessment of alternative methods of diagnostic categorization. Currently, the best classifiers combine optimum features from multiple modalities, including {MRI}, [({18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET}, {CSF} biomarkers, and clinical tests; (4) the development of methods for the early detection of {AD.} {CSF} biomarkers, β-amyloid 42 and tau, as well as amyloid {PET} may reflect the earliest steps in {AD} pathology in mildly symptomatic or even nonsymptomatic subjects, and are leading candidates for the detection of {AD} in its preclinical stages; (5) the improvement of clinical trial efficiency through the identification of subjects most likely to undergo imminent future clinical decline and the use of more sensitive outcome measures to reduce sample sizes. Baseline cognitive and/or {MRI} measures generally predicted future decline better than other modalities, whereas {MRI} measures of change were shown to be the most efficient outcome measures; (6) the confirmation of the {AD} risk loci {CLU}, {CR1}, and {PICALM} and the identification of novel candidate risk loci; (7) worldwide impact through the establishment of {ADNI-like} programs in Europe, Asia, and Australia; (8) understanding the biology and pathobiology of normal aging, {MCI}, and {AD} through integration of {ADNI} biomarker data with clinical data from {ADNI} to stimulate research that will resolve controversies about competing hypotheses on the etiopathogenesis of {AD}, thereby advancing efforts to find disease-modifying drugs for {AD;} and (9) the establishment of infrastructure to allow sharing of all raw and processed data without embargo to interested scientific investigators throughout the world. The {ADNI} study was extended by a 2-year Grand Opportunities grant in 2009 and a renewal of {ADNI} ({ADNI-2)} in October 2010 through to 2016, with enrollment of an additional 550 participants.},

The author proposes such a blind identification procedure. Source signatures are directly identified as covariance eigenvectors after data have been orthonormalized and nonlinearly weighted.

	volume = {8},
	abstract = {In recent work, several authors have introduced methods for sparse canonical correlation analysis (sparse {CCA).} Suppose that two sets of measurements are available on the same set of observations. Sparse {CCA} is a method for identifying sparse linear combinations of the two sets of variables that are highly correlated with each other. It has been shown to be useful in the analysis of high-dimensional genomic data, when two sets of assays are available on the same set of samples. In this paper, we propose two extensions to the sparse {CCA} methodology. (1) Sparse {CCA} is an unsupervised method; that is, it does not make use of outcome measurements that may be available for each observation (e.g., survival time or cancer subtype). We propose an extension to sparse {CCA}, which we call sparse supervised {CCA}, which results in the identification of linear combinations of the two sets of variables that are correlated with each other and associated with the outcome. (2) It is becoming increasingly common for researchers to collect data on more than two assays on the same set of samples; for instance, {SNP}, gene expression, and {DNA} copy number measurements may all be available. We develop sparse multiple {CCA} in order to extend the sparse {CCA} methodology to the case of more than two data sets. We demonstrate these new methods on simulated data and on a recently published and publicly available diffuse large B-cell lymphoma data set. Copyright © 2009 The Berkeley Electronic Press.

	abstract = {Arterial spin labeling has relatively low spatial resolution, which affects cerebral blood flow measurements by partial volume effect occurring at tissue interfaces, e.g., between gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. This can be an important source of cerebral blood flow quantification error. To correct for partial volume effect in arterial spin labeling, a linear regression method was recently proposed. Because this method assumes that tissue magnetization and cerebral blood flow are constant over an n2 × 1 regression kernel, an inherent spatial blurring is introduced. In this study, a modified least trimmed squares algorithm is proposed for partial volume effect correction. It is demonstrated using simulations that the modified least trimmed square method can correct for partial volume effect and produce less blurring than the linear regression method. This is achieved without either acquiring additional datasets or increasing the computation burden. These capabilities were further demonstrated in vivo. The modified least trimmed square method should, therefore, play an important role in arterial spin labeling studies. Magn Reson Med, 2013. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Amnestic mild cognitive impairment ({aMCI)} is a syndrome widely considered to be prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Accurate diagnosis of {aMCI} would enable earlier treatment, and could thus help minimize the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease. The aim of the present study was to evaluate a magnetic resonance imaging-based automated classification schema for identifying {aMCI.} This was carried out in a sample of community-dwelling adults aged 70-90years old: 79 with a clinical diagnosis of {aMCI} and 204 who were cognitively normal. Our schema was novel in using measures of both spatial atrophy, derived from T1-weighted images, and white matter alterations, assessed with diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI)} tract-based spatial statistics ({TBSS).} Subcortical volumetric features were extracted using a {FreeSurfer-initialized} Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping ({FS+LDDMM)} segmentation approach, and fractional anisotropy ({FA)} values obtained for white matter regions of interest. Features were ranked by their ability to discriminate between {aMCI} and normal cognition, and a support vector machine ({SVM)} selected an optimal feature subset that was used to train {SVM} classifiers. As evaluated via 10-fold cross-validation, the classification performance characteristics achieved by our schema were: accuracy, 71.09\%; sensitivity, 51.96\%; specificity, 78.40\%; and area under the curve, 0.7003. Additionally, we identified numerous socio-demographic, lifestyle, health and other factors potentially implicated in the misclassification of individuals by our schema and those previously used by others. Given its high level of performance, our classification schema could facilitate the early detection of {aMCI} in community-dwelling elderly adults.},

In autism spectrum disorders ({ASDs)}, white matter alterations may contribute to characteristic deficits in complex socio-emotional and communication domains. Here, we used diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI)} and tract based spatial statistics ({TBSS)} to evaluate white matter microstructure in {ASD.} {Methods/Principal} Findings: {DTI} scans were acquired for 19 children and adolescents with {ASD} ({\textasciitilde}8-18 years; mean 12.4±3.1) and 16 age and {IQ} matched controls ({\textasciitilde}8-18 years; mean 12.3±3.6) on a {3T} {MRI} system. {DTI} values for fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity and axial diffusivity, were measured. Age by group interactions for global and voxel-wise white matter indices were examined. Voxel-wise analyses comparing {ASD} with controls in: (i) the full cohort (ii), children only (≤12 yrs.), and (iii) adolescents only ({\textgreater}12 yrs.) were performed, followed by tract-specific comparisons. Significant age-by-group interactions on global {DTI} indices were found for all three diffusivity measures, but not for fractional anisotropy. Voxel-wise analyses revealed prominent diffusion measure differences in {ASD} children but not adolescents, when compared to healthy controls. Widespread increases in mean and radial diffusivity in {ASD} children were prominent in frontal white matter voxels. Follow-up tract-specific analyses highlighted disruption to pathways integrating frontal, temporal, and occipital structures involved in socio-emotional processing. {Conclusions/Significance:} Our findings highlight disruption of neural circuitry in {ASD}, particularly in those white matter tracts that integrate the complex socio-emotional processing that is impaired in this disorder. © 2011 Ameis et al.},

By using Locality Preserving Projections ({LPP)}, the face images are mapped into a face subspace for analysis. Different from Principal Component Analysis ({PCA)} and Linear Discriminant Analysis ({LDA)} which effectively see only the Euclidean structure of face space, {LPP} finds an embedding that preserves local information, and obtains a face subspace that best detects the essential face manifold structure. The Laplacianfaces are the optimal linear approximations to the eigenfunctions of the Laplace Beltrami operator on the face manifold. In this way, the unwanted variations resulting from changes in lighting, facial expression, and pose may be eliminated or reduced. Theoretical analysis shows that {PCA}, {LDA}, and {LPP} can be obtained from different graph models. We compare the proposed Laplacianface approach with Eigenface and Fisherface methods on three different face data sets. Experimental results suggest that the proposed Laplacianface approach provides a better representation and achieves lower error rates in face recognition. © 2005 {IEEE.}},

The purpose of this study was to determine the inversion time with the largest difference in normalized intratumoral signal intensity between high-grade and low-grade astrocytomas.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} Thirty-three patients with gliomas, histologically classified as low-grade (n = 7) or high-grade astrocytomas (n = 26) according to the World Health Organization brain tumor classification, were included. A {3T} {MR} scanner was used to perform pulsed arterial spin-labeling measurements at 8 different inversion times (370 ms, 614 ms, 864 ms, 1114 ms, 1364 ms, 1614 ms, 1864 ms, and 2114 ms). Normalized intratumoral signal intensity was calculated, which was defined by the signal intensity ratio of the tumor and the contralateral normal brain tissue for all fixed inversion times. A 3-way mixed {ANOVA} was used to reveal potential differences in the normalized vascular intratumoral signal intensity between high-grade and low-grade astrocytomas.
{RESULTS:} The difference in normalized vascular intratumoral signal intensity between high-grade and low-grade astrocytomas obtained the most statistically significant results at 370 ms (P = .003, other P values ranged from .012–.955).
{CONCLUSIONS:} The inversion time by which to differentiate high-grade and low-grade astrocytomas by use of normalized vascular intratumoral signal intensity was 370 ms in our study. The normalized vascular intratumoral signal intensity values at this inversion time mainly reflect the labeled intra-arterial blood bolus and therefore could be referred to as normalized vascular intratumoral signal intensity. Our data indicate that the use of normalized vascular intratumoral signal intensity values allows differentiation between low-grade and high-grade astrocytomas and thus may serve as a new, noninvasive marker for astrocytoma grading.},

	abstract = {Abstract
Previous research suggests statistical associations between season of birth ({SOB)} with prevalence of neurobehavioral disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, personality traits, and suicidal behavior. These effects are thought to be mediated by seasonal differences in perinatal photoperiod, which was recently shown to imprint circadian clock neurons and behavior in rodents. However, it is unknown whether {SOB} is associated with any measurable differences in the normal human adult brain, and whether individual {SOB} can be deduced based on phenotype. Here I show that {SOB} predicts neuroanatomical differences in regional grey matter volume, and that {MRI} scans carry spatially distributed information allowing significantly above chance prediction of an individual’s {SOB.} Using an open source database of over 550 structural brain scans, Voxel-Based Morphometry ({VBM)} analysis showed a significant {SOB} effect in left superior temporal gyrus ({STG)} in males (p = 0.009, {FWE} whole-brain corrected), with greater grey matter volumes in fall and winter births. A cosinor analysis revealed a significant annual periodicity in left {STG} grey matter volume (Zero Amplitude Test: p \&lt; 5x10- 7), with a peak towards the end of December and a nadir towards the end of June, suggesting that perinatal photoperiod accounts for this {SOB} effect. Whole-brain {VBM} maps were used as input features to multivariate machine-learning based analyses to classify {SOB.} Significantly greater than chance prediction was achieved in females (overall accuracy 35\%, p \&lt; 0.001), but not in males (overall accuracy 26\%, p = 0.45). Pair-wise binary classification in females revealed the highest discrimination was obtained for winter vs. summer classification (peak area under the {ROC} curve = 0.71, p \&lt; 0.0005). Discriminating regions included fusiform and middle temporal gyrus, inferior and superior parietal lobe, cerebellum, and dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Results indicate {SOB} is detectable with {MRI}, imply {SOB} exerts effects on the developing human brain that persist through adulthood, and suggest neuroimaging may be a valuable intermediate phenotype in bridging the gap between {SOB} and personality and neurobehavioral disorders.},

	abstract = {Partial volume effects ({PVE)} are a consequence of limited spatial resolution in brain imaging. In arterial spin labeling ({ASL)} {MRI}, the problem is exacerbated by the nonlinear dependency of the {ASL} signal on magnetization contributions from each tissue within an imaged voxel. We have developed an algorithm that corrects for {PVE} in {ASL} imaging. The algorithm is based on a model that represents the voxel intensity as a weighted sum of pure tissue contribution, where the weighting coefficients are the tissue's fractional volume in the voxel. Using this algorithm, we were able to estimate cerebral blood flow ({CBF)} for gray matter ({GM)} and white matter ({WM)} independently. The average voxelwise ratio of {GM} to {WM} {CBF} was ∼3.2, in good agreement with reports in the literature. As proof of concept, data from {PVE-corrected} method were compared with those from the conventional, {PVE-uncorrected} method. As hypothesized, the two yielded similar {CBF} values for voxels containing {\textgreater}95\% {GM} and differed in proportion with the voxels' heterogeneity. More importantly, the {GM} {CBF} assessed with the {PVE-corrected} method was independent of the voxels' heterogeneity, implying that estimation of flow was unaffected by {PVE.} An example of application of this algorithm in motor-activation data is also given.

In particular, a set of multi-scale and multi-orientation Gabor attributes are extracted and the optimal components are selected, so that they form a highly distinctive morphological signature reflecting the anatomical and geometric context around each voxel. Moreover, the way in which the optimal Gabor attributes are constructed is independent of the underlying image modalities or contents, which renders {DRAMMS} generally applicable to diverse registration tasks. A second contribution of {DRAMMS} is that it modulates the registration by assigning higher weights to those voxels having higher ability to establish unique (hence reliable) correspondences across images, therefore reducing the negative impact of those regions that are less capable of finding correspondences (such as outlier regions). A continuously-valued weighting function named "mutual-saliency" is developed to reflect the matching uniqueness between a pair of voxels implied by the tentative transformation. As a result, voxels do not contribute equally as in most voxel-wise methods, nor in isolation as in landmark/feature-based methods. Instead, they contribute according to the continuously-valued mutual-saliency map, which dynamically evolves during the registration process. Experiments in simulated images, inter-subject images, single-/multi-modality images, from brain, heart, and prostate have demonstrated the general applicability and the accuracy of {DRAMMS.}},

A diffeomorphic registration based cortical thickness ({DiReCT)} measure is introduced where a continuous one-to-one correspondence between the gray matter-white matter interface and the estimated gray matter-cerebrospinal fluid interface is given by a diffeomorphic mapping in the image space. Thickness is then defined in terms of a distance measure between the interfaces of this sheet like structure. This technique also provides a natural way to compute continuous estimates of thickness within buried sulci by preventing opposing gray matter banks from intersecting. In addition, the proposed method incorporates neuroanatomical constraints on thickness values as part of the mapping process. Evaluation of this method is presented on synthetic images. As an application to brain images, a longitudinal study of thickness change in frontotemporal dementia ({FTD)} spectrum disorder is reported. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

One hundred three patient charts were included from a tertiary vestibular physical therapy practice. The patients ranged in age from 14-90 years and had vestibular diagnoses, falls reported in the patient chart, and completed the {TUG} and/or the Dynamic Gait Index ({DGI).} Thirty-one persons reported falling one or more times in the previous 6 months during their initial assessment. Persons who took longer than 13.5 seconds to perform the {TUG} test were 3.7 times more likely to have reported a fall in the previous 6 months. Those persons with scores less than or equal to 18 on the {DGI} were 2.7 times (p = 0.03) more likely to have reported a fall in the previous 6 months. The sensitivity of the {DGI} at 18 or less was 70\% and the specificity was 51\%. People who scored greater than 11.1 seconds on the {TUG} were 5times (p = 0.001) more likely to have reported a fall in the previous 6 months. Sensitivity (80\%) and specificity (56\%) were calculated for {TUG} scores of greater than 11.1 seconds. The {TUG} and the {DGI} appear to be helpful in identifying fall risk in persons with vestibular dysfunction. Slower scores on the {TUG} ({\textgreater} 11.1 seconds) and lower scores on the {DGI} (18) correlated with reports of falls in persons with vestibular dysfunction.},

	abstract = {Due to the limited spatial resolution of positron emission tomography ({PET)}, the accuracy of quantitative measurements of regional metabolism or neuroreceptor concentration is influenced by partial volume averaging of brain with {CSF}, bone, and scalp. This effect is increased in the presence of cortical atrophy, as in patients with Alzheimer disease ({AD).} Correction for this underestimation in {PET} measurements is necessary for the comparison of {AD} patients and normal controls. We have developed a method for three-dimensional correction of human {PET} data using magnetic resonance ({MR)} imaging. A composite brain tissue image is created by summing the binary representation of nine {MR} images, weighted to the {PET} z-axis line-spread function. This composite tissue image is convolved to the resolution of the {PET} image. The original {PET} image is divided by the convolved tissue image on a pixel-by-pixel basis, resulting in an atrophy-corrected {PET} image in which count density represents activity per volume of brain tissue rather than spatial volume. This has been performed in [{11C]carfentanil} mu-opiate receptor {PET} studies of the temporal cortex in two {AD} patients and one normal volunteer. After correction, average regional increases in count density were 11\% (range = 4-21\%) in the normal and 46\% (range = 28-99\%) and 48\% (range = 14-109\%) in the patient studies. The accuracy of this method of partial volume correction was estimated using a spherical phantom.},

Early in apoptosis, cytochrome c translocates to the endoplasmic reticulum where it selectively binds {InsP(3)R}, resulting in sustained, oscillatory cytosolic calcium increases. These calcium events are linked to the coordinate release of cytochrome c from all mitochondria. Our findings identify a feed-forward mechanism whereby early cytochrome c release increases {InsP(3)R} function, resulting in augmented cytochrome c release that amplifies the apoptotic signal.},

	abstract = {Modern {MRI} image processing methods have yielded quantitative, morphometric, functional, and structural assessments of the human brain. These analyses typically exploit carefully optimized protocols for specific imaging targets. Algorithm investigators have several excellent public data resources to use to test, develop, and optimize their methods. Recently, there has been an increasing focus on combining {MRI} protocols in multi-parametric studies. Notably, these have included innovative approaches for fusing connectivity inferences with functional and/or anatomical characterizations. Yet, validation of the reproducibility of these interesting and novel methods has been severely hampered by the limited availability of appropriate multi-parametric data. We present an imaging protocol optimized to include state-of-the-art assessment of brain function, structure, micro-architecture, and quantitative parameters within a clinically feasible 60-min protocol on a 3-T {MRI} scanner. We present scan-rescan reproducibility of these imaging contrasts based on 21 healthy volunteers (11 M/10 F, 22-61 years old). The cortical gray matter, cortical white matter, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid, thalamus, putamen, caudate, cerebellar gray matter, cerebellar white matter, and brainstem were identified with mean volume-wise reproducibility of 3.5\%. We tabulate the mean intensity, variability, and reproducibility of each contrast in a region of interest approach, which is essential for prospective study planning and retrospective power analysis considerations. Anatomy was highly consistent on structural acquisition ({\textasciitilde}1-5\% variability), while variation on diffusion and several other quantitative scans was higher ({\textasciitilde}{\textless}10\%). Some sequences are particularly variable in specific structures ({ASL} exhibited variation of 28\% in the cerebral white matter) or in thin structures (quantitative T2 varied by up to 73\% in the caudate) due, in large part, to variability in automated {ROI} placement. The richness of the joint distribution of intensities across imaging methods can be best assessed within the context of a particular analysis approach as opposed to a summary table. As such, all imaging data and analysis routines have been made publicly and freely available. This effort provides the neuroimaging community with a resource for optimization of algorithms that exploit the diversity of modern {MRI} modalities. Additionally, it establishes a baseline for continuing development and optimization of multi-parametric imaging protocols.},

Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

	abstract = {To further understanding of basic and complex cognitive functions, previous connectome research has identified functional and structural connections of the human brain. Functional connectivity is often measured by using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-{fMRI)} and is generally interpreted as an indirect measure of neuronal activity. Gray matter ({GM)} primarily consists of neuronal and glia cell bodies; therefore, it is surprising that the majority of connectome research has excluded {GM} measures. Therefore, we propose that by exploring where {GM} corresponds to function would aid in the understanding of both structural and functional connectivity and in turn the human connectome. A cohort of 603 healthy participants underwent structural and functional scanning on the same 3 T scanner at the Mind Research Network. To investigate the spatial correspondence between structure and function, spatial independent component analysis ({ICA)} was applied separately to both {GM} density ({GMD)} maps and to rs-{fMRI} data. {ICA} of {GM} delineates structural components based on the covariation of {GMD} regions among subjects. For the rs-{fMRI} data, {ICA} identified spatial patterns with common temporal features. These decomposed structural and functional components were then compared by spatial correlation. Basal ganglia components exhibited the highest structural to resting-state functional spatial correlation (r = 0.59). Cortical components generally show correspondence between a single structural component and several resting-state functional components. We also studied relationships between the weights of different structural components and identified the precuneus as a hub in {GMD} structural network correlations. In addition, we analyzed relationships between component weights, age, and gender; concluding that age has a significant effect on structural components.},

First, a regional statistical feature extraction scheme was adopted to capture discriminative features from voxel-wise morphometric and functional representations of brain images, in order to reduce the dimensionality of the features used for classification, as well as to achieve the robustness to registration error and inter-subject variations. Then, this feature extraction method was used in conjunction with a hybrid feature selection method and a nonlinear support vector machine for the classification of brain abnormalities. This brain classification approach has been applied to detecting the brain abnormality associated with prenatal cocaine exposure in adolescents. A promising classification performance was achieved on a data set of 49 subjects (24 normal and 25 prenatally cocaine-exposed teenagers), with a leave-one-out cross-validation. Experimental results demonstrated the efficacy of our method, as well as the importance of incorporating both structural and functional images for brain classification. Moreover, spatial patterns of group difference derived from the constructed classifier were mostly consistent with the results of the conventional statistical analysis method. Therefore, the proposed approach provided not only a multivariate classification method for detecting brain abnormalities, but also an alternative way for group analysis of multimodality images.},

Tests measuring working memory, naming/lexical retrieval, and semantic knowledge were also obtained. {MRI} voxel-based morphometry ({VBM)} studies were obtained on a subset of these patients ({bvFTLD}, n = 51; {PNFA}, n = 11; {SemD}, n = 10).

Results:
Patients with {SemD} were disproportionately impaired on the semantic fluency measure. Reduced output on this test was correlated with impaired performance on naming/lexical retrieval tests. {VBM} analyses related reduced letter and semantic fluency to anterior and inferior left temporal lobe atrophy. Patients with {bvFTLD} were equally impaired on both fluency tests. Poor performance on both fluency tests was correlated with low scores on working memory and naming/lexical retrieval measures. In this group, {MRI-VBM} analyses related letter fluency to bilateral frontal atrophy and semantic fluency to left frontal/temporal atrophy. Patients with {PNFA} were also equally impaired on fluency tests. Reduced semantic fluency output was correlated with reduced performance on naming/lexical retrieval tests. {MRI-VBM} analyses related semantic fluency to the right frontal lobe and letter fluency to left temporal atrophy.

Conclusions:
Distinct neurocognitive networks underlie impaired performance on letter and semantic fluency tests in frontotemporal lobar degeneration subgroups.

To study hemodynamics in greater detail, volumetric arterial spin labeling {MRI} with variable postlabeling delays was used together with a distributed, dual-compartment tracer model. The main goal was to determine how {CBF} and other perfusion hemodynamics vary with aging. Twenty cognitive normal female and 15 male subjects (age: 23-84 years old) were studied at 4 T. Arterial spin labeling measurements were performed in the posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and whole brain gray matter. {CBF} declined with advancing age (P {\textless} 0.001). Separately from variations in bolus arrival times, arterial-arteriole transit time increased with advancing age (P {\textless} 0.01). Finally, women had overall higher {CBF} values (P {\textless} 0.01) and shorter arterial-arteriole transit time (P {\textless} 0.01) than men, regardless of age. The findings imply that {CBF} and blood transit times are compromised in aging, and these changes together with differences between genders should be taken into account when studying brain perfusion.},

In particular, image-based multivariate prediction models and the “relevant features” they produce are attracting attention from the community. In this article, we present an empirical study on the relevant features produced by two recently developed discriminative learning algorithms: neighborhood approximation forests ({NAF)} and the relevance voxel machine ({RVoxM).} Specifically, we examine whether the sets of features these methods produce are exhaustive; that is whether the features that are not marked as relevant carry disease-related information. We perform experiments on three different problems: image-based regression on a synthetic dataset for which the set of relevant features is known, regression of subject age as well as binary classification of Alzheimer’s Disease ({AD)} from brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging ({MRI)} data. Our experiments demonstrate that aging-related and {AD-related} variations are widespread and the initial sets of relevant features discovered by the methods are not exhaustive. Our findings show that by knocking-out features and re-training models, a much larger set of disease-related features can be identified.},

	abstract = {The role of hypoperfusion in Alzheimer's disease ({AD)} is a vital component to understanding the pathogenesis of this disease. Disrupted perfusion is not only evident throughout disease manifestation, it is also demonstrated during the pre-clinical phase of {AD} (i.e., mild cognitive impairment) as well as in cognitively healthy persons at high-risk for developing {AD} due to family history or genetic factors. Studies have used a variety of imaging modalities (e.g., {SPECT}, {MRI}, {PET)} to investigate {AD}, but with its recent technological advancements and non-invasive use of blood water as an endogenous tracer, arterial spin labeling ({ASL)} {MRI} has become an imaging technique of growing popularity. Through numerous {ASL} studies, it is now known that {AD} is associated with both global and regional cerebral hypoperfusion and that there is considerable overlap between the regions implicated in the disease state (consistently reported in precuneus/posterior cingulate and lateral parietal cortex) and those implicated in disease risk. Debate exists as to whether decreased blood flow in {AD} is a cause or consequence of the disease. Nonetheless, hypoperfusion in {AD} is associated with both structural and functional changes in the brain and offers a promising putative biomarker that could potentially identify {AD} in its pre-clinical state and be used to explore treatments to prevent, or at least slow, the progression of the disease. Finally, given that perfusion is a vascular phenomenon, we provide insights from a vascular lesion model (i.e., stroke) and illustrate the influence of disrupted perfusion on brain structure and function and, ultimately, cognition in {AD.}},

Depression of apparent isotope concentration in an image for objects equal in size to the instrument resolution ({FWHM)} was significant (50\% for a cylinder and 25\% for a bar). For objects larger than 1.0 {FWHM}, accurate object sizes can be estimated from the images. Thus, reasonably accurate and practical schemes of compensation for object size effects can be implemented for objects larger than 1.0 {FWHM.} Accuracy in quantitating isotope concentrations in smaller objects is seriously compromised by the loss of sensitivity to the object size and the large correction factors required to compensate for instrument response.

Both genetic variants and brain region abnormalities are recognized as important factors for complex diseases (e.g., {schizophrenia).In} this paper, we investigated the correspondence between single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP)} and brain activity measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI)} to understand how genetic variation influences the brain activity. A group sparse canonical correlation analysis method (group sparse {CCA)} was developed to explore the correlation between these two datasets which are high dimensional-the number of {SNPs/voxels} is far greater than the number of samples. Different from the existing sparse {CCA} methods ({sCCA)}, our approach can exploit structural information in the correlation analysis by introducing group constraints. A simulation study demonstrates that it outperforms the existing {sCCA.} We applied this method to the real data analysis and identified two pairs of significant canonical variates with average correlations of 0.4527 and 0.4292 respectively, which were used to identify genes and voxels associated with schizophrenia. The selected genes are mostly from 5 schizophrenia ({SZ)-related} signalling pathways. The brain mappings of the selected voxles also indicate the abnormal brain regions susceptible to schizophrenia. A gene and brain region of interest ({ROI)} correlation analysis was further performed to confirm the significant correlations between genes and {ROIs.}},

Accurate estimation of location and extent of neuronal sources from {EEG/MEG} remains challenging. In the present study, a new source imaging method, i.e. variation and wavelet based sparse source imaging ({VW-SSI)}, is proposed to better estimate cortical source locations and extents. {VW-SSI} utilizes the L1-norm regularization method with the enforcement of transform sparseness in both variation and wavelet domains. The performance of the proposed method is assessed by both simulated and experimental {MEG} data, obtained from a language task and a motor task. Compared to L2-norm regularizations, {VW-SSI} demonstrates significantly improved capability in reconstructing multiple extended cortical sources with less spatial blurredness and less localization error. With the use of transform sparseness, {VW-SSI} overcomes the over-focused problem in classic {SSI} methods. With the use of two transformations, {VW-SSI} further indicates significantly better performance in estimating {MEG} source locations and extents than other {SSI} methods with single transformations. The present experimental results indicate that {VW-SSI} can successfully estimate neural sources (and their spatial coverage) located in close areas while responsible for different functions, i.e. temporal cortical sources for auditory and language processing, and sources on the pre-bank and post-bank of the central sulcus. Meantime, all other methods investigated in the present study fail to recover these phenomena. Precise estimation of cortical source locations and extents from {EEG/MEG} is of significance for applications in neuroscience and neurology.},

	abstract = {Although the patterns of structural and metabolic brain alterations in Alzheimer's disease are being refined and discrepancies between them are being underlined, the exact relationships between atrophy and hypometabolism are still unclear. In this study, we aimed to provide a direct comparison between grey matter atrophy and hypometabolism in a sample of patients with clinically probable Alzheimer's disease, using a voxel-based method specially designed to statistically compare the two imaging modalities. Eighteen patients with probable Alzheimer's disease of mild severity and 15 healthy aged controls underwent both high-resolution T1 {MRI} and resting-state {18FDG-PET.} The {MRI} data sets were handled using optimized {VBM.} The {PET} data were coregistered to their corresponding {MRI}, corrected voxel-wise for partial volume averaging and spatially normalized using the same parameters as those of their corresponding {MRI} volume. A differential smoothing was applied on the {MRI} and {PET} data sets to equalize their effective smoothness and resolution. For each patient, Z-score maps of atrophy and hypometabolism were created by comparing to the controls data set, respectively averaged to provide the profile of hypometabolism and atrophy, and entered in a voxel-by-voxel {SPM} analysis to assess the statistical differences between hypometabolism and atrophy. The observed patterns of hypometabolism and atrophy were consistent with previous studies. However, the direct comparison revealed marked regional variability in the relationship between hypometabolism and atrophy. Thus, the hypometabolism significantly exceeded atrophy in most altered structures, particularly in the posterior cingulate-precuneus, orbitofrontal, inferior temporo-parietal, parahippocampal, angular and fusiform areas. In contrast, a few hypometabolic structures among which the hippocampus exhibited similar degrees of atrophy and hypometabolism, a profile that significantly differed from the posterior cingulate. Excessive hypometabolism relative to atrophy suggests the intervention of additional hypometabolism-inducing factors, such as disconnection and amyloid deposition, resulting in genuine functional perturbation ahead of actual atrophy and perhaps of pathology as well. Conversely, in the hippocampus, where disconnection processes are also likely to occur, relative synaptic compensatory mechanisms may be taking place, maintaining neuronal activity in the face of structural alterations.},

	abstract = {The early identification of brain anatomy deviating from the normal pattern of growth and atrophy, such as in Alzheimer's disease ({AD)}, has the potential to improve clinical outcomes through early intervention. Recently, Davatzikos et al. (2009) supported the hypothesis that pathologic atrophy in {AD} is an accelerated aging process, implying accelerated brain atrophy. In order to recognize faster brain atrophy, a model of healthy brain aging is needed first. Here, we introduce a framework for automatically and efficiently estimating the age of healthy subjects from their T1-weighted {MRI} scans using a kernel method for regression. This method was tested on over 650 healthy subjects, aged 19–86 years, and collected from four different scanners. Furthermore, the influence of various parameters on estimation accuracy was analyzed. Our age estimation framework included automatic preprocessing of the T1-weighted images, dimension reduction via principal component analysis, training of a relevance vector machine ({RVM;} Tipping, 2000) for regression, and finally estimating the age of the subjects from the test samples. The framework proved to be a reliable, scanner-independent, and efficient method for age estimation in healthy subjects, yielding a correlation of r = 0.92 between the estimated and the real age in the test samples and a mean absolute error of 5 years. The results indicated favorable performance of the {RVM} and identified the number of training samples as the critical factor for prediction accuracy. Applying the framework to people with mild {AD} resulted in a mean brain age gap estimate ({BrainAGE)} score of + 10 years.},

This long "preclinical" phase of {AD} would provide a critical opportunity for therapeutic intervention; however, we need to further elucidate the link between the pathological cascade of {AD} and the emergence of clinical symptoms. The National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association convened an international workgroup to review the biomarker, epidemiological, and neuropsychological evidence, and to develop recommendations to determine the factors which best predict the risk of progression from "normal" cognition to mild cognitive impairment and {AD} dementia. We propose a conceptual framework and operational research criteria, based on the prevailing scientific evidence to date, to test and refine these models with longitudinal clinical research studies. These recommendations are solely intended for research purposes and do not have any clinical implications at this time. It is hoped that these recommendations will provide a common rubric to advance the study of preclinical {AD}, and ultimately, aid the field in moving toward earlier intervention at a stage of {AD} when some disease-modifying therapies may be most efficacious.},

The goal of this study was to evaluate the prognostic ability of genetic, {CSF}, neuroimaging, and cognitive measurements obtained in the same participants.
Methods: {APOE} ε4 allele frequency, {CSF} proteins (Aβ1-42, total tau, hyperphosphorylated tau [p-tau181p]), glucose metabolism ({FDG-PET)}, hippocampal volume, and episodic memory performance were evaluated at baseline in patients with amnestic {MCI} (n = 85), using data from a large multisite study (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative). Patients were classified as normal or abnormal on each predictor variable based on externally derived cutoffs, and then variables were evaluated as predictors of subsequent conversion to Alzheimer disease ({AD)} and cognitive decline (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment {Scale–Cognitive} Subscale) during a variable follow-up period (1.9 ± 0.4 years).
Results: Patients with {MCI} converted to {AD} at an annual rate of 17.2\%. Subjects with {MCI} who had abnormal results on both {FDG-PET} and episodic memory were 11.7 times more likely to convert to {AD} than subjects who had normal results on both measures (p ≤ 0.02). In addition, the {CSF} ratio p-{tau181p/Aβ1-42} (β = 1.10 ± 0.53; p = 0.04) and, marginally, {FDG-PET} predicted cognitive decline.
Conclusions: Baseline {FDG-PET} and episodic memory predict conversion to {AD}, whereas p-{tau181p/Aβ1-42} and, marginally, {FDG-PET} predict longitudinal cognitive decline. Complementary information provided by these biomarkers may aid in future selection of patients for clinical trials or identification of patients likely to benefit from a therapeutic intervention.},

Grade {3B} follicular lymphoma ({FL)}, consisting almost exclusively of centroblasts, is a distinct subgroup of follicular lymphomas that has more in common clinically with the aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphomas than with their indolent {FL} grade 1 and 2 counterparts. We studied the cytogenetic and molecular genetic aberrations by classic cytogenetics, polymerase chain reaction, Southern blot hybridization, and fluorescence in situ hybridization, with special emphasis on t(14;18), affecting bcl-2, and 3q27 rearrangement, affecting bcl-6, in 32 cases of {FL} grade {3B.} Three distinctive subgroups were identified based upon the existence of breakpoint 3q27, a translocation t(14;18), or the absence of both. Group I involved a t(14;18) and no 3q27 aberrations (n = 13); group {II} was without a t(14;18) and without 3q27 aberrations (n = 9), but had other cytogenetic aberrations; and group {III} was without a t(14;18) but with aberrations involving 3q27 (n = 10). None of the {FL} grade {3B} cases harbored both a t(14;18) and 3q27 aberration. These results, in particular the finding of a mutual exclusiveness of bcl-2 and bcl-6 rearrangement, indicate at least 3 different pathways of oncogenesis in {FL} grade {3B.} {FL} grade {3B} with bcl-2 rearrangement probably is part of the same entity as the other follicular lymphomas (1, 2, {3A)}, whereas the cases with 3q27 abnormalities or other unrelated translocations are more closely related to the majority of diffuse large-cell lymphomas of germinal center cell origin.},

A generalized {EM} algorithm for maximum a posteriori estimation of the pixel labels based upon these prior densities is derived. This algorithm incorporates a variation of gradient projection in the maximization step and the resulting algorithm takes the form of grouped coordinate ascent. Gaussian densities have been used for simplicity, but the algorithm can easily be modified to incorporate other appropriate models for the mixture model component densities. The accuracy of the algorithm is quantitatively evaluated through Monte Carlo simulation, and its performance is qualitatively assessed via experimental images from computerized tomography ({CT)} and magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI).}},

Little is known about the neurological effects of blast-related {mTBI} and whether they differ from those of civilian, non-blast {mTBI.} Given that brain damage from blasts may be diffuse and heterogeneous, we tested the hypothesis that blast {mTBI} is associated with subtle white matter disruptions in the brain that are spatially inconsistent across individuals. We used diffusion tensor imaging to examine white matter integrity, as quantified by fractional anisotropy ({FA)}, in a group of American military service members with (n=25) or without (n=33) blast-related {mTBI} who had been deployed as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom. History of civilian non-blast {mTBI} was equally common across groups, which enabled testing of both blast and non-blast {mTBI} effects on measures sensitive to (1) concentrated, spatially consistent (average {FA} within a region of interest [{ROI])}, (2) concentrated, spatially variable (number of {ROIs} with low average {FA)}, and (3) diffuse (number of voxels with low {FA)} disruptions of white matter integrity. Blast {mTBI} was associated with a diffuse, global pattern of lower white matter integrity, and this pattern was not affected by previous civilian {mTBI.} Neither type of {mTBI} had an effect on the measures sensitive to more concentrated and spatially consistent white matter disruptions. Additionally, individuals with more than one blast {mTBI} tended to have a larger number of low {FA} voxels than individuals with a single blast injury. These results indicate that blast {mTBI} is associated with disrupted integrity of several white matter tracts, and that these disruptions are diluted by averaging across the large number of voxels within an {ROI.} The reported pattern of effects supports the conclusion that the neurological effects of blast {mTBI} are diffuse, widespread, and spatially variable.},

The method aims to estimate the statistical variation of a normative set of images from healthy individuals, and identify abnormalities as deviations from normality. A direct estimation of the statistical variation of the entire volumetric image is challenged by the high-dimensionality of images relative to smaller sample sizes. To overcome this limitation, we iteratively sample a large number of lower dimensional subspaces that capture image characteristics ranging from fine and localized to coarser and more global. Within each subspace, a “target-specific” feature selection strategy is applied to further reduce the dimensionality, by considering only imaging characteristics present in a test subject’s images. Marginal probability density functions of selected features are estimated through {PCA} models, in conjunction with an “estimability” criterion that limits the dimensionality of estimated probability densities according to available sample size and underlying anatomy variation. A test sample is iteratively projected to the subspaces of these marginals as determined by {PCA} models, and its trajectory delineates potential abnormalities. The method is applied to segmentation of various brain lesion types, and to simulated data on which superiority of the iterative method over straight {PCA} is demonstrated.},

The graph Laplacian is split into two components: within-class graph and between-class graph to better characterize the discriminant property of the data. Our approach has two important characteristics: (i) it adaptively estimates the local neighborhood surrounding each sample based on data density and similarity and (ii) the objective function simultaneously maximizes the local margin between heterogeneous samples and pushes the homogeneous samples closer to each other. Our approach has been tested on several challenging face databases and it has been conveniently compared with other linear and non-linear techniques, demonstrating its superiority. Although we have concentrated in this paper on the face recognition problem, the proposed approach could also be applied to other category of objects characterized by large variations in their appearance (such as hand or body pose, for instance). © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {While medical imaging typically provides massive amounts of data, the extraction of relevant information for predictive diagnosis remains a difficult challenge. Functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI)} data, that provide an indirect measure of task-related or spontaneous neuronal activity, are classically analyzed in a mass-univariate procedure yielding statistical parametric maps. This analysis framework disregards some important principles of brain organization: population coding, distributed and overlapping representations. Multivariate pattern analysis, i.e., the prediction of behavioral variables from brain activation patterns better captures this structure. To cope with the high dimensionality of the data, the learning method has to be regularized. However, the spatial structure of the image is not taken into account in standard regularization methods, so that the extracted features are often hard to interpret. More informative and interpretable results can be obtained with the ℓ1 norm of the image gradient, also known as its total variation ({TV)}, as regularization. We apply for the first time this method to {fMRI} data, and show that {TV} regularization is well suited to the purpose of brain mapping while being a powerful tool for brain decoding. Moreover, this article presents the first use of {TV} regularization for classification.},

These models have strong explanatory power as measured by R$^{\textrm{2}}$ and deviance reduction, while providing complementary and corroborative results. Some factors, like changes to the eye status, affect all algorithms similarly. Other factors, such as race, affect different algorithms differently.

	abstract = {All fields of neuroscience that employ brain imaging need to communicate their results with reference to anatomical regions. In particular, comparative morphometry and group analysis of functional and physiological data require coregistration of brains to establish correspondences across brain structures. It is well established that linear registration of one brain to another is inadequate for aligning brain structures, so numerous algorithms have emerged to nonlinearly register brains to one another. This study is the largest evaluation of nonlinear deformation algorithms applied to brain image registration ever conducted. Fourteen algorithms from laboratories around the world are evaluated using 8 different error measures. More than 45,000 registrations between 80 manually labeled brains were performed by algorithms including: {AIR}, {ANIMAL}, {ART}, Diffeomorphic Demons, {FNIRT}, {IRTK}, {JRD-fluid}, {ROMEO}, {SICLE}, {SyN}, and four different {SPM5} algorithms ({"SPM2-type"} and regular Normalization, Unified Segmentation, and the {DARTEL} Toolbox). All of these registrations were preceded by linear registration between the same image pairs using {FLIRT.} One of the most significant findings of this study is that the relative performances of the registration methods under comparison appear to be little affected by the choice of subject population, labeling protocol, and type of overlap measure. This is important because it suggests that the findings are generalizable to new subject populations that are labeled or evaluated using different labeling protocols. Furthermore, we ranked the 14 methods according to three completely independent analyses (permutation tests, one-way {ANOVA} tests, and indifference-zone ranking) and derived three almost identical top rankings of the methods. {ART}, {SyN}, {IRTK}, and {SPM's} {DARTEL} Toolbox gave the best results according to overlap and distance measures, with {ART} and {SyN} delivering the most consistently high accuracy across subjects and label sets.

The reduced regional white matter volume correlated with decreased serum cholinesterase levels and with the severity of chronic somatic complaints related to interoceptive awareness. Voxel-based analysis of diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging further demonstrated an extensively lower than normal fractional anisotropy in the victims. All these findings were statistically significant (corrected p {\textless} {0.05).InterpretationSarin} intoxication might be associated with structural changes in specific regions of the human brain, including those surrounding the insular cortex, which might be related to elevated subjective awareness of internal bodily status in exposed individuals.

We propose a new variant of Isomap algorithm based on local linear properties of manifolds to increase its robustness to short-circuiting.

Age-related thinning of the cortical mantle varies regionally, leading to hemispheric asymmetries in cortical thickness that may emerge at various stages of development and aging. Cortical asymmetry may play a role in modulating the functional maturation (or degradation) of language and cognition in humans, but its evolution over the lifespan is unknown. Here cortical thickness was negatively correlated with age in 274 5–59 year old, right-handed healthy participants. Pre-adolescents showed limited regions of cortical asymmetry focused on medial occipital lobe (R \&gt; L) and inferior frontal gyrus (R \&gt; L), namely vision and language relevant areas. More extensive frontal (lateral R \&gt; L, medial L \&gt; R) and parietal lobe (lateral L \&gt; R, medial R \&gt; L) asymmetries emerged after adolescence, and increased during aging. Changes of cortical asymmetry in these regions may be linked to specialization of the brain with maturity.},

It was then applied to 72 stroke patients to detect brain areas associated with motor outcome at 90 days, based on diffusion-weighted images acquired at the acute stage (median delay one day). The proposed method showed that poor motor outcome is associated to changes in the corticospinal bundle and white matter tracts originating from the premotor cortex.

	abstract = {Coordinated patterns of cortical morphology have been described as structural graphs and previous research has demonstrated that properties of such graphs are altered in Alzheimer's disease ({AD).} However, it remains unknown how these alterations are related to cognitive deficits in individuals, as such graphs are restricted to group-level analysis. In the present study we investigated this question in single-subject grey matter networks. This new method extracts large-scale structural graphs where nodes represent small cortical regions that are connected by edges when they show statistical similarity. Using this method, unweighted and undirected networks were extracted from T1 weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging scans of 38 {AD} patients (19 female, average age 72±4 years) and 38 controls (19 females, average age 72±4 years). Group comparisons of standard graph properties were performed after correcting for grey matter volumetric measurements and were correlated to scores of general cognitive functioning. {AD} networks were characterised by a more random topology as indicated by a decreased small world coefficient (p = 3.53×10−5), decreased normalized clustering coefficient (p = 7.25×10−6) and decreased normalized path length (p = 1.91×10−7). Reduced normalized path length explained significantly (p = 0.004) more variance in measurements of general cognitive decline (32\%) in comparison to volumetric measurements (9\%). Altered path length of the parahippocampal gyrus, hippocampus, fusiform gyrus and precuneus showed the strongest relationship with cognitive decline. The present results suggest that single-subject grey matter graphs provide a concise quantification of cortical structure that has clinical value, which might be of particular importance for disease prognosis. These findings contribute to a better understanding of structural alterations and cognitive dysfunction in {AD.}},

	abstract = {Huntington's disease ({HD)} is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder that is currently untreatable. A prominent feature of {HD} pathology is the reduction of the pro-survival neurotrophin Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor ({BDNF).} Both {mRNA} and protein levels of {BDNF} are decreased in the brains of several {HD} rodent models and in human {HD} patients. We now report for the first time that this molecular event is mirrored in blood from {HD} rodent models. While protein levels of {BDNF} are undetectable in mouse blood, {mRNA} levels are measurable and diminish during {HD} progression in transgenic mouse (R6/2) and rat models of {HD.} Among the eight different {BDNF} transcripts, only {BDNF} exon {III} is transcribed in mouse blood and its expression is progressively compromised in R6/2 mice with respect to age-matched wild-types. Assessment of {BDNF} {mRNA} in {HD} rat blood shows a similar result, which is reinforced by evidence that protein levels of the neurotrophin are also significantly reduced at a symptomatic stage. Finally, we demonstrate that acute and chronic treatment of R6/2 mice with {CEP-1347}, a mixed lineage kinase ({MLK)} inhibitor with neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects, leads to increased total {BDNF} {mRNA} in blood when compared to untreated R6/2 mice. Our results indicate that alterations in {BDNF} {mRNA} levels in peripheral blood are a readily accessible measurement of disease progression and drug efficacy in {HD} rodent models.},

	abstract = {There are growing numbers of studies using machine learning approaches to characterize patterns of anatomical difference discernible from neuroimaging data. The high-dimensionality of image data often raises a concern that feature selection is needed to obtain optimal accuracy. Among previous studies, mostly using fixed sample sizes, some show greater predictive accuracies with feature selection, whereas others do not. In this study, we compared four common feature selection methods. 1) Pre-selected region of interests ({ROIs)} that are based on prior knowledge. 2) Univariate t-test filtering. 3) Recursive feature elimination ({RFE)}, and 4) t-test filtering constrained by {ROIs.} The predictive accuracies achieved from different sample sizes, with and without feature selection, were compared statistically. To demonstrate the effect, we used grey matter segmented from the T1-weighted anatomical scans collected by the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative ({ADNI)} as the input features to a linear support vector machine classifier. The objective was to characterize the patterns of difference between Alzheimer's disease ({AD)} patients and cognitively normal subjects, and also to characterize the difference between mild cognitive impairment ({MCI)} patients and normal subjects. In addition, we also compared the classification accuracies between {MCI} patients who converted to {AD} and {MCI} patients who did not convert within the period of 12 months. Predictive accuracies from two data-driven feature selection methods (t-test filtering and {RFE)} were no better than those achieved using whole brain data. We showed that we could achieve the most accurate characterizations by using prior knowledge of where to expect neurodegeneration (hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus). Therefore, feature selection does improve the classification accuracies, but it depends on the method adopted. In general, larger sample sizes yielded higher accuracies with less advantage obtained by using knowledge from the existing literature.},

These rules are similar in spirit to the efficient Armijo rule for the method of steepest descent and under mild assumptions they have the desirable property that they identify the set of active inequality constraints in a finite number of iterations. As a result the method may be converted towards the end of the process to a conjugate direction, quasi-Newton or Newton's method, and achieve the attendant superlinear convergence rate. As an example we propose some quadratically convergent combinations of the method with Newton's method. Such combined methods appear to be very efficient for large-scale problems with many simple constraints such as those often appearing in optimal control.},

Tangent shape vector is treated as the hidden state of the model, and accordingly, an {EM} based searching algorithm is proposed to implement the {MAP} procedure. The major results of our algorithm are: 1) tangent shape is updated by a weighted average of two shape vectors, the projection of the observed shape onto tangent space, and the reconstruction of shape parameters. 2) Shape parameters are regularized by multiplying a ratio of the noise variations, which is a continuous function instead of a truncated function. We discussed the advantages conveyed by these results, and demonstrate the accuracy and the stability of the algorithm by extensive experiments.},

These patterns contribute unequally to the structure of the expression profiles. Moreover, the essential features of a given set of expression profiles are captured using just a small number of characteristic modes. This leads to the striking conclusion that the transcriptional response of a genome is orchestrated in a few fundamental patterns of gene expression change. These patterns are both simple and robust, dominating the alterations in expression of genes throughout the genome. Moreover, the characteristic modes of gene expression change in response to environmental perturbations are similar in such distant organisms as yeast and human cells. This analysis reveals simple regularities in the seemingly complex transcriptional transitions of diverse cells to new states, and these provide insights into the operation of the underlying genetic networks.},

In order to study such cortical properties in humans, it is necessary to obtain an accurate and explicit representation of the cortical surface in individual subjects. Here we describe a set of automated procedures for obtaining accurate reconstructions of the cortical surface, which have been applied to data from more than 100 subjects, requiring little or no manual intervention. Automated routines for unfolding and flattening the cortical surface are described in a companion paper. These procedures allow for the routine use of cortical surface-based analysis and visualization methods in functional brain imaging.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a statistical parts-based model ({PBM)} of appearance, applied to the problem of modeling intersubject anatomical variability in magnetic resonance ({MR)} brain images. In contrast to global image models such as the active appearance model ({AAM)}, the {PBM} consists of a collection of localized image regions, referred to as parts, whose appearance, geometry and occurrence frequency are quantified statistically. The parts-based approach explicitly addresses the case where one-to-one correspondence does not exist between all subjects in a population due to anatomical differences, as model parts are not required to appear in all subjects. The model is constructed through a fully automatic machine learning algorithm, identifying image patterns that appear with statistical regularity in a large collection of subject images. Parts are represented by generic scale-invariant features, and the model can, therefore, be applied to a wide variety of image domains. Experimentation based on 2-D {MR} slices shows that a {PBM} learned from a set of 102 subjects can be robustly fit to 50 new subjects with accuracy comparable to 3 human raters. Additionally, it is shown that unlike global models such as the {AAM}, {PBM} fitting is stable in the presence of unexpected, local perturbation.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

New preclinical Alzheimer disease ({AD)} diagnostic criteria have been developed using biomarkers in cognitively normal ({CN)} adults. We implemented these criteria using an {MRI} biomarker previously associated with {AD} dementia, testing the hypothesis that individuals at high risk for preclinical {AD} would be at elevated risk for cognitive decline.


{METHODS}

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database was interrogated for {CN} individuals. {MRI} data were processed using a published set of a priori regions of interest to derive a single measure known as the {AD} signature ({ADsig).} Each individual was classified as {ADsig-low} (≥ 1 {SD} below the mean: high risk for preclinical {AD)}, {ADsig-average} (within 1 {SD} of mean), or {ADsig-high} (≥ 1 {SD} above mean). A 3-year cognitive decline outcome was defined a priori using change in Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes and selected neuropsychological measures.


{RESULTS}

Individuals at high risk for preclinical {AD} were more likely to experience cognitive decline, which developed in 21\% compared with 7\% of {ADsig-average} and 0\% of {ADsig-high} groups (p = 0.03). Logistic regression demonstrated that every 1 {SD} of cortical thinning was associated with a nearly tripled risk of cognitive decline (p = 0.02). Of those for whom baseline {CSF} data were available, 60\% of the high risk for preclinical {AD} group had {CSF} characteristics consistent with {AD} while 36\% of the {ADsig-average} and 19\% of the {ADsig-high} groups had such {CSF} characteristics (p = 0.1).


{CONCLUSIONS}

This approach to the detection of individuals at high risk for preclinical {AD-identified} in single {CN} individuals using this quantitative {ADsig} {MRI} biomarker-may provide investigators with a population enriched for {AD} pathobiology and with a relatively high likelihood of imminent cognitive decline consistent with prodromal {AD.}},

In the {ADNI} cohort, a logistic regression model for Aβ1–42, t-tau, and {APOε4} allele count provided the best assessment delineation of mild {AD.} An {AD-like} baseline {CSF} profile for t-{tau/Aβ1–42} was detected in 33 of 37 {ADNI} mild cognitive impairment subjects who converted to probable {AD} during the first year of the {study.InterpretationThe} {CSF} biomarker signature of {AD} defined by Aβ1–42 and t-tau in the autopsy-confirmed {AD} cohort and confirmed in the cohort followed in {ADNI} for 12 months detects mild {AD} in a large, multisite, prospective clinical investigation, and this signature appears to predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment to {AD.} Ann Neurol 2009},

Such a problem arises naturally in many practical situations with the multifactor analysis-of-variance problem as the most important and well-known example. Instead of selecting factors by stepwise backward elimination, we focus on the accuracy of estimation and consider extensions of the lasso, the {LARS} algorithm and the non-negative garrotte for factor selection. The lasso, the {LARS} algorithm and the non-negative garrotte are recently proposed regression methods that can be used to select individual variables. We study and propose efficient algorithms for the extensions of these methods for factor selection and show that these extensions give superior performance to the traditional stepwise backward elimination method in factor selection problems. We study the similarities and the differences between these methods. Simulations and real examples are used to illustrate the methods.},

	volume = {32},
	abstract = {The purpose of model selection algorithms such as All Subsets, Forward Selection and Backward Elimination is to choose a linear model on the basis of the same set of data to which the model will be applied. Typically we have available a large collection of possible covariates from which we hope to select a parsimonious set for the efficient prediction of a response variable. Least Angle Regression ({LARS)}, a new model selection algorithm, is a useful and less greedy version of traditional forward selection methods. Three main properties are derived: (1) A simple modification of the {LARS} algorithm implements the Lasso, an attractive version of ordinary least squares that constrains the sum of the absolute regression coefficients; the {LARS} modification calculates all possible Lasso estimates for a given problem, using an order of magnitude less computer time than previous methods. (2) A different {LARS} modification efficiently implements Forward Stagewise linear regression, another promising new model selection method; this connection explains the similar numerical results previously observed for the Lasso and Stagewise, and helps us understand the properties of both methods, which are seen as constrained versions of the simpler {LARS} algorithm. (3) A simple approximation for the degrees of freedom of a {LARS} estimate is available, from which we derive a C 
                        p estimate of prediction error; this allows a principled choice among the range of possible {LARS} estimates. {LARS} and its variants are computationally efficient: the paper describes a publicly available algorithm that requires only the same order of magnitude of computational effort as ordinary least squares applied to the full set of covariates. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2004.},

We apply the {SCCA} model to a dataset that includes 23 control subjects that are demographically matched to 49 subjects with autopsy or {CSF-biomarker-diagnosed} {AD} (n=24) and {FTD} (n=25) with both {DTI} and T1-weighted structural imaging. {SCCA} shows that the {FTD-related} frontal and temporal degeneration pattern is correlated across modalities with permutation corrected p{\textless}0.0005. In {AD}, we find significant association between cortical thinning and reduction in white matter integrity within a distributed parietal and temporal network (p{\textless}0.0005). Furthermore, we show that-within {SCCA} identified regions-significant differences exist between {FTD} and {AD} cortical-connective degeneration patterns. We validate these distinct, multimodal imaging patterns by showing unique relationships with cognitive measures in {AD} and {FTD.} We conclude that {SCCA} is a potentially valuable approach in image analysis that can be applied productively to distinguishing between neurodegenerative conditions.},

First, a continuous diffusion tensor field is constructed from this discrete, noisy, measured {DT-MRI} data. Then a Frenet equation, describing the evolution of a fiber tract, was solved. This approach was validated using synthesized, noisy {DT-MRI} data. Corpus callosum and pyramidal tract trajectories were constructed and found to be consistent with known anatomy.

Moreover, background noise in diffusion-weighted {MRIs} can cause a computed trajectory to hop from tract to tract. Still, this method can provide quantitative information with which to visualize and study connectivity and continuity of neural pathways in the central and peripheral nervous systems in vivo, and holds promise for elucidating architectural features in other fibrous tissues and ordered media.

Instead, an image covariance matrix is constructed directly using the original image matrices, and its eigenvectors are derived for image feature extraction. To test {2DPCA} and evaluate its performance, a series of experiments were performed on three face image databases: {ORL}, {AR}, and Yale face databases.

	abstract = {In functional brain mapping, pattern recognition methods allow detecting multivoxel patterns of brain activation which are informative with respect to a subject's perceptual or cognitive state. The sensitivity of these methods, however, is greatly reduced when the proportion of voxels that convey the discriminative information is small compared to the total number of measured voxels. To reduce this dimensionality problem, previous studies employed univariate voxel selection or region-of-interest-based strategies as a preceding step to the application of machine learning algorithms.

Here we employ a strategy for classifying functional imaging data based on a multivariate feature selection algorithm, Recursive Feature Elimination ({RFE)} that uses the training algorithm (support vector machine) recursively to eliminate irrelevant voxels and estimate informative spatial patterns. Generalization performances on test data increases while features/voxels are pruned based on their discrimination ability.

In this article we evaluate {RFE} in terms of sensitivity of discriminative maps (Receiver Operative Characteristic analysis) and generalization performances and compare it to previously used univariate voxel selection strategies based on activation and discrimination measures. Using simulated {fMRI} data, we show that the recursive approach is suitable for mapping discriminative patterns and that the combination of an initial univariate activation-based (F-test) reduction of voxels and multivariate recursive feature elimination produces the best results, especially when differences between conditions have a low contrast-to-noise ratio.

Furthermore, we apply our method to high resolution (2 × 2 × 2mm3) data from an auditory {fMRI} experiment in which subjects were stimulated with sounds from four different categories. With these real data, our recursive algorithm proves able to detect and accurately classify multivoxel spatial patterns, highlighting the role of the superior temporal gyrus in encoding the information of sound categories. In line with the simulation results, our method outperforms univariate statistical analysis and statistical learning without feature selection.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This paper presents a novel fuzzy-segmentation method for diffusion tensor ({DT)} and magnetic resonance ({MR)} images. Typical fuzzy-segmentation schemes, e.g., those based on fuzzy C means ({FCM)}, incorporate Gaussian class models that are inherently biased towards ellipsoidal clusters characterized by a mean element and a covariance matrix. Tensors in fiber bundles, however, inherently lie on specific manifolds in Riemannian spaces. Unlike {FCM-based} schemes, the proposed method represents these manifolds using nonparametric data-driven statistical models. The paper describes a statistically-sound (consistent) technique for nonparametric modeling in Riemannian {DT} spaces. The proposed method produces an optimal fuzzy segmentation by maximizing a novel information-theoretic energy in a Markov-random-field framework. Results on synthetic and real, {DT} and {MR} images, show that the proposed method provides information about the uncertainties in the segmentation decisions, which stem from imaging artifacts including noise, partial voluming, and inhomogeneity. By enhancing the nonparametric model to capture the spatial continuity and structure of the fiber bundle, we exploit the framework to extract the cingulum fiber bundle. Typical tractography methods for tract delineation, incorporating thresholds on fractional anisotropy and fiber curvature to terminate tracking, can face serious problems arising from partial voluming and noise. For these reasons, tractography often fails to extract thin tracts with sharp changes in orientation, such as the cingulum. The results demonstrate that the proposed method extracts this structure significantly more accurately as compared to tractography.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Although distinct resting-state networks related to vision, language, executive processing, and other sensory and cognitive domains have been identified, considerable skepticism remains as to whether resting-state functional connectivity maps reflect neural connectivity or simply track {BOLD} signal correlations driven by nonneural artifact. Here we combine diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI)} tractography with resting-state {fcMRI} to test the hypothesis that resting-state functional connectivity reflects structural connectivity. These 2 modalities were used to investigate connectivity within the default mode network, a set of brain regions—including medial prefrontal cortex ({MPFC)}, medial temporal lobes ({MTLs)}, and posterior cingulate cortex ({PCC)/retropslenial} cortex ({RSC)—implicated} in episodic memory processing. Using seed regions from the functional connectivity maps, the {DTI} analysis revealed robust structural connections between the {MTLs} and the retrosplenial cortex whereas tracts from the {MPFC} contacted the {PCC} (just rostral to the {RSC).} The results demonstrate that resting-state functional connectivity reflects structural connectivity and that combining modalities can enrich our understanding of these canonical brain networks.},

Standard voxel-based morphometry ({VBM)} analyzes imaging data voxel-by-voxel--and follows this with cluster-based or voxel-wise multiple comparisons correction methods to determine significance. Eigenanatomy reverses the standard order of operations by first clustering the voxel data and then using standard linear regression in this reduced dimensionality space. As with traditional region-of-interest ({ROI)} analysis, this strategy can greatly improve detection power. Our results show that eigenanatomy provides a principled objective function that leads to localized, data-driven regions of interest.

Our evaluation uses gold standard, human cortical segmentation to contrast {SyN’s} performance with a related elastic method and with the standard {ITK} implementation of Thirion’s Demons algorithm. The new method compares favorably with both approaches, in particular when the distance between the template brain and the target brain is large. We then report the correlation of volumes gained by algorithmic cortical labelings of {FTD} and control subjects with those gained by the manual rater. This comparison shows that, of the three methods tested, {SyN’s} volume measurements are the most strongly correlated with volume measurements gained by expert labeling. This study indicates that {SyN}, with cross-correlation, is a reliable method for normalizing and making anatomical measurements in volumetric {MRI} of patients and at-risk elderly individuals.},

	abstract = {Compensatory counter-rotations of the eyes provoked by head turns are commonly attributed to the vestibulo-ocular reflex ({VOR).} A recent study in guinea pigs demonstrates, however, that this assumption is not always valid. During voluntary head turns, guinea pigs make highly accurate compensatory eye movements that occur with zero or even negative latencies with respect to the onset of the provoking head movements. Furthermore, the anticipatory eye movements occur in animals with bilateral peripheral vestibular lesions, thus confirming that they have an extra vestibular origin. This discovery suggests the possibility that anticipatory responses might also occur in other species including humans and non-human primates, but have been overlooked and mistakenly identified as being produced by the {VOR.} This review will compare primate and guinea pig vestibular physiology in light of these new findings. A unified model of vestibular and cerebellar pathways will be presented that is consistent with current data in primates and guinea pigs. The model is capable of accurately simulating compensatory eye movements to active head turns (anticipatory responses) and to passive head perturbations ({VOR} induced eye movements) in guinea pigs and in human subjects who use coordinated eye and head movements to shift gaze direction in space.

Anticipatory responses provide new evidence and opportunities to study the role of extra vestibular signals in motor control and sensory–motor transformations. Exercises that employ voluntary head turns are frequently used to improve visual stability in patients with vestibular hypofunction. Thus, a deeper understanding of the origin and physiology of anticipatory responses could suggest new translational approaches to rehabilitative training of patients with bilateral vestibular loss.},
